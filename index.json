We consider a grid of simulations varying the cloud masses between $m\\_{gas}=10^3$ M$\\_\\odot$ to $3 \\times 10^5$ M$\\_\\odot$, and resolving scales between 200 AU to 2000 AU. We consider molecular clouds with gas mean number densities typical of those observed in the local universe ($\\overline n\\_{gas} \\sim 1.8\\times 10^2$ cm$^{-3}$) and denser molecular clouds ($\\overline n\\_{gas} \\sim 1.8 \\times 10^3$ cm$^{-3}$ and $1.8 \\times 10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) expected to exist, according to cosmological simulations, in high-redshift galaxies. We also partially explore varying the gas metallicity. \u0026emsp; In this paper, the first of a series, we focus on the analysis of the initial mass function (IMF), the star formation rate (SFR), and the total star formation efficiency (TSFE) in molecular clouds . These are the main results: i) We find that the observed Salpeter power-law slope and normalisation of the stellar IMF at the high-mass end can be reproduced if we assume that each star-forming gas clump (sink particle) fragments into stars producing on average a maximum stellar mass about $40\\%$ of the mass of the sink particle, while the remaining $60\\%$ is distributed into smaller mass stars. This empirical prescription, and an IMF reproducing a Chabrier IMF, can be obtained assuming that the sinks fragment according to a power-law mass function flatter than Salpeter, with log-slope $\\Gamma\\sim 0.8$. This result is in agreement with the observed mass function of dense cores in some molecular clouds. ii) The star formation law that best describes our set of simulation is $d\\rho\\_\\star/dt \\propto \\rho\\_{gas}^{1.5}$ if $\\overline{n}\\_{gas}\\n\\_{cri}$. The duration of the star formation episode of roughly $6$ sound crossing times of the cloud radius (with $c\\_s=10$ km/s). iii) For gas at solar metallicity the TSFE in the cloud is $f\\_\\star=2\\% (m\\_{gas}/10^4 M\\_\\odot)^{0.4}(1+\\overline n\\_{gas}/n\\_{cri})^{0.91}$, also in agreement with (ii).

The non-spherical shape of the disk as well as blocking of the neutron star by the disk make the observed flux dependent on the inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line of sight. This is of importance for the interpretation of thermonuclear X-ray bursts from neutron stars. Because part of the X-ray burst is reflected off the disk, the observed burst flux depends on the anisotropies for both direct emission from the neutron star and reflection off the disk. This influences measurements of source distance, mass accretion rate, and constraints on the neutron star's equation of state. Previous predictions of the anisotropy factors assumed a geometrically flat disk. Detailed observations of two so-called superbursts allowed for the direct and the reflected burst fluxes to each be measured separately. The reflection fraction was much higher than what the anisotropies of a flat disk can account for. We create numerical models to calculate the anisotropy factors for different disk shapes, including concave disks. We present the anisotropy factors of the direct and reflected burst fluxes separately, as well as the anisotropy of the persistent flux. Reflection fractions substantially larger than unity are produced in the case where the inner accretion disk increases steeply in height, such that part of the star is blocked from view. Such a geometry could possibly be induced by the X-ray burst if X-ray heating causes the inner disk to puff up.","tags":["accretion","accretion disks","stars: neutron","X-rays: binaries","X-rays: bursts"],"title":"Anisotropy of X-Ray Bursts from Neutron Stars with Concave Accretion Disks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"this is my CV\nName: CC He\nPub\n- He: 2016 - He: 2019  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552972074,"objectID":"7e6115c4d209379befeb3847e8c4905b","permalink":"https://chongchonghe.github.io/cv/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cv/","section":"","summary":"this is my CV\nName: CC He\nPub\n- He: 2016 - He: 2019  ","tags":null,"title":"CV","type":"page"}]
