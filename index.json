The non-spherical shape of the disk as well as blocking of the neutron star by the disk make the observed flux dependent on the inclination angle of the disk with respect to the line of sight. This is of importance for the interpretation of thermonuclear X-ray bursts from neutron stars. Because part of the X-ray burst is reflected off the disk, the observed burst flux depends on the anisotropies for both direct emission from the neutron star and reflection off the disk. This influences measurements of source distance, mass accretion rate, and constraints on the neutron star's equation of state. Previous predictions of the anisotropy factors assumed a geometrically flat disk. Detailed observations of two so-called superbursts allowed for the direct and the reflected burst fluxes to each be measured separately. The reflection fraction was much higher than what the anisotropies of a flat disk can account for. We create numerical models to calculate the anisotropy factors for different disk shapes, including concave disks. We present the anisotropy factors of the direct and reflected burst fluxes separately, as well as the anisotropy of the persistent flux. Reflection fractions substantially larger than unity are produced in the case where the inner accretion disk increases steeply in height, such that part of the star is blocked from view. Such a geometry could possibly be induced by the X-ray burst if X-ray heating causes the inner disk to puff up.","tags":["accretion","accretion disks","stars: neutron","X-rays: binaries","X-rays: bursts"],"title":"Anisotropy of X-Ray Bursts from Neutron Stars with Concave Accretion Disks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"this is my CV\nName: CC He\nPub\n- He: 2016 - He: 2019  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552972074,"objectID":"7e6115c4d209379befeb3847e8c4905b","permalink":"https://chongchonghe.github.io/cv/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/cv/","section":"","summary":"this is my CV\nName: CC He\nPub\n- He: 2016 - He: 2019  ","tags":null,"title":"CV","type":"page"}]
