<h2>ASTR100 Introduction to Astronomy</h2>

<h3>Hi, everyone...</h3>
<p>
	I'm ChongChong He, the TA of ASTR100 (Sections 0104 and 0105). I am here to 
	guide you toward a better understanding of astronomy. This website is used to 
	provide solutions to homework and discussion problems, presentation slides, useful information, 
	and materials that I use in the discussion. The syllabus for our discussion is available
	<a href="./ASTR100/discussion_syllabus.pdf">here</a>.
</p>

		<b>Make-up policy</b>
		<!-- Our discussion schedule is fixed, but your schedule may very. -->
		<!-- There might be situations that you can't make it to the discussion,  -->
		You are given one chance in the whole semester to miss a discussion 
		<!-- with a pre-notified excuse  -->
		and have a make-up section 
		during my office hours. After that, you won’t get grades for your future 
		absence of a discussion section without a valid excuse (see the course 
		syllabus for details.)

from pure attendance.</p> -->
