      <description>$\alpha$ Emission from neutron stars and accretion disks in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) is not isotropic. Previous studies made predictions of the anisotropy factors for burst flux, assuming a geometrically flat disk. In this case, the ratio of the reflected and direct burst flux ($\xi_{r}^{-1}/\xi_{d}^{-1}$, or the reflection fraction) peaks at 0.5. Recently (2014), however, detailed observations showed that the reflection fraction could reach to ~6 at the tail of a superburst (top right), which is much higher than what a system with a flat disk can account for.</description>
