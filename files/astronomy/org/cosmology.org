For a source to radiate in gravitational wave, it must have the following properties:
- The amplitude must scale as $1/r$ far from the source. This is because if it scales as r to the negative two or higher, no energy is carried to infinity.
- The lowest order radiation has to be quadrupolar, and hence depends on the quadrupole moment $I_{ij} = \int \rho r_i r_j d^3 x \propto MR^2$. 

Combining the two, we have
$$
h \sim M R^2 / r \, ,
$$
which has the unit of distance squared (or mass squared, or time squared). The make h dimensionless, we take two time derivatives, since time varying is also required to produce a radiation. Putting back $G$ and $c$ to restore the correct units, we have
$$
h \approx \frac{G}{c^{4}} \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial^{2}(MR^{2})}{\partial t^{2}}
$$
Replacing $\partial^2/\partial t^2$ with $f_{\rm dyn}^2$ and $f_{\rm dyn} \approx \sqrt{GM/R^3}$, we have
$$
h \approx \frac{G^2 M^2}{r R c^4} \approx \left( \frac{GM}{R c^{2}} \right) \left( \frac{GM}{r c^{2}} \right).
$$
The first term is just the internal gravitational potential of the system, while the second term is the gravitational potential of the sytem at the observer's location. They are also the ratio of the gravitational radius, $R_g$, to the radius of the sytem, $R$, and the ratio of $R_g$ to the distance to the observer, $r$, i.e. $h \sim \frac{R_g}{R} \frac{R_g}{r}$.

To apply the back-of-the-envelope estimates to a gravitatioanl wave source, a binary system of two neutron stars. The following numerical formula are given with respect to a system consisting of two 1.4 solar mass neutron stars separated by 90 km at a distance of 15 Mpc.

* Plack Scales

*Defining the Planck scale* The Planck length is defined by taking the constants of nature and combining them in such a way that their units combine to give a length. The combination of Planck's constant, h, Newton's constant G, and the speed of light c that gives length is:
\[
L_P = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}} = \num{1.6e-35}~{\rm m},
\]

known as the *Planck length*. The *Planck time* is then defined as the Planck length devided by the speed of light, which equals 5.4e-44 seconds. The *Planck mass*, defined similarly by combining basic constants to get a mass, is
\[
m_p = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}},
\]
which equals 2.18e-5 g. Note that for the Planck mass, the Schwarzschild radius ($r_S = 2 L_P$) and Compton wavelength ($\lambda_C = 2 \pi l_P$) are of same order as the Planck length. (Indeed, =2 G mp / c2 = 2 sqrt(G hbar / c3) = 2 Lp=. 

A interesting fact I notice: The Hawking radiation timescale of a black hole at the Planck mass is very close to the Planck time.
