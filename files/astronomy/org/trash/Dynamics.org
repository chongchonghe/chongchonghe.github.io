#+title: Dynamics

* Concepts

** Terms

- *Jeans modeling*: Jeans dynamical modeling: Solve the Jeans equations (or the [[https://clumpy.gitlab.io/CLUMPY/physics_jeans.html#jeans-equation][CBE, collisionless Boltzmann equation]], with link to the CLUMPY code on gitlab.). ▪ Advantages: Very fast, no need to assume a distribution function ▪ Disadvantages: Must bin data to calculate moments, no guarantee there is a DF matching moments, calculation is difficult without assumption of symmetry

- *CBE*: [[https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~jhibbard/students/CPower/dynamics/cbe/cbe.html][webpage]]. 

* Star cluster dynamics

** Core collapse

Core collapse of star clusters.
- New method: B. P. B. Bhat, cumulative number distribution of stars (Aspen talk)

* N-body

- Dynamics - Anisotropy parameter beta  = 1 - sigma_phi^2 / sigma_r^2. (Anna's talk)
