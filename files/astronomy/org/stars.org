*** Stellar spectrum types

The Harvard classification scheme of "O B A F G K M" (Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me) is a temperature sequence, running from the hottest blue O stars to the coolest red M stars. Stars nearer the beginning of this sequence are referred to as early-type star, and those closer to the end are called late-type stars. Subdivisions like a K0 star is referred as "early K star".

WR stars are stars with unusual spectra showing prominent broad
emission lines of ionised helium and highly ionised nitrogen or
carbon. The spectra indicate very high surface enhancement of heavy
elements, depletion of hydrogen, and strong stellar winds. They are
"bare cores" left over from the peeling of massive stars by stellar
winds.

Properties:

- Masses: 8-25 Msun (up to 80 Msun)
- Luminosities: 10^5-6.5 Lsun
- Eddington factor: ~0.7 to ~1.0
- Teff: 3e4 to 1.5e5 K.
- $\dot{M}$: ~5e-6 to 1e-4 Msun/yr
- Lifetime: ~5e5 yr

** Energy production in stars
   :PROPERTIES:

   :END:

The net reaction from which most stars gain their energy is:
$\rm 4{}^1H\rightarrow{}^4He+2e^++2\nu_{\rm e}+\gamma$.\\
This reaction produces 26.72 MeV. Two reaction chains are responsible
for this reaction. The slowest, speed-limiting reaction is shown in
boldface. The energy between brackets is the energy carried away by the
neutrino.

1. The proton-proton chain has two subchains:\\
   $\bf ^1H+p^+\rightarrow{}^2D+e^++\nu_{\bf e}$, Â and then
   $\rm ^2D+p\rightarrow{}^3He+\gamma$.

2. The CNO cycle.

* Star Formation

** Star Formation: Observations

/Molecular Tracers/.
- *The problem with H$_2$*: The low mass of the hydrogen atom makes the exitation energy very high. This is because the level spacing of a quantum oscillator veries with reduced mass as $m^{-1/2}$. In addition, H2 is homonuclear molecule, so the first level of rotational transition is forbidden, and the second level is 510 K above the ground state.

/Infrared luminosity as a star formation rate tracer./ Underlying assumptions: most of the radiant output in the galaxy comes form young, recently formed stars, and (2) in a dusty galaxy most of the starlight will be absorbed by dust grains within the galaxy and then re-radiated in the infrared. This can be explored using the popular *stellar population synthesis* (SPS) package *Starburst99*.

In the simulations, and , therefore $v_A / \sigma$ = 0.2, where $\sigma$
is the turbulence velocity dispersion.

*** Instability

**** Jeans Instability
<<sec:jeans>>

We define the *Jeans length*
$$\lambda_{\rm J} \equiv c_{\rm s} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{G \bar\rho}} = 5.00\,{\rm pc} \; \mu^{-1} T_1^{1/2} n_2^{-1/2} = 172\,{\rm pc} \; \left ( \frac{c_{s}}{1\,\si{km/s}} \right ) \left( \frac{n}{1\,\si{cm^{-3}}} \right)^{-1/2}  $$
# calc: cs = 0.29 km/s, rho = 100 mpcc, cs sqrt(pi / G / rho)
and the Jeans mass [fn:1]
$$M_{\rm J} \equiv \frac{4\pi}{3} \left( \frac{\lambda_{\rm J}}{2}\right)^3 \bar\rho
  = \frac{\pi^{5/2}}{6} \frac{c_{\rm s}^3}{(G^3 \bar\rho)^{1/2}}
  = 52.6~\msun \; \left( \frac{c_s}{0.2~\si{km~s^{-1}}} \right)^3 \left( \mu~n_2 \right)^{-1/2}
  = 160~\msun \, \mu^{-2} T_1^{3/2} n_2^{-1/2}
  = 82~\msun \, T_1^{3/2} n_2^{-1/2} (\mu = 1.4),
  $$
where $n$ is the /particle number density/ and $\mu$ is the /mean particle weight/. 
# calc: cs = 0.2 km/s, rho = 100 m_p/cm^3, pi^(5/2)/6 * cs^3/(G^3 * rho)^(1/2)
# assuming $\gamma = 5/3$. The $40~\msun$ part has molecular hydrogen and it is copied from Eq. 9.3 of \cite{Mo2010}.

The *Bonnor-Ebert mass* is an equivalent to the Jeans mass in an isothermal sphere in pressure equilibrium with its surrounding, which may be a more appropriate description for molecular clumps and cores. [fn:2]
$$\label{eq:MBE}
  M_{\rm BE} = 1.182 \frac{c_s^3}{(G^3 \rho)^{1/2}} = 0.41 M_{\rm J}$$
Krumholz's notes ("STAR FORMATION IN MOLECULAR CLOUDS", Problem Set 2) [fn:3] has very nice and detailed derivation of the Bonnor-Ebert mass. The idea is that, given a surface pressure $P_s$ and sound speed $c_s$ there exists a maximum mass at which the cloud can be in hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e. $M_{\rm BE}$. This mass is calculated by solving the isothermal *Lane-Emden* equation and find that the total mass achieves maximum when $\rho_c / \rho_s \approx 14.0$.

**** Toomre Instability

The Toomre $Q$ parameter for a disk with Keplerian/flat rotation curve is

\begin{align*}
Q&=\;\cfrac{\Omega c_s}{\pi G \Sigma} ,  \;\; &&{\rm Keplerian}\\
  &=\;\cfrac{\sqrt{2} \Omega c_s}{\pi G \Sigma},\;\; &&{\rm flat} \\
  &=\;\cfrac{2 \Omega c_s}{\pi G \Sigma},\;\; &&{\rm rigid}
\end{align*}

assuming the non-thermal velocity dispersion in the disk is subsonic. The disk is unstable when $Q < 1$. More generally, for a differentially rotating disk, $k \Omega$ ($k$ is the constant in front) should be replaced with the epicyclic frequence $\kappa$. 

$$
\kappa^2 = \frac{2\Omega}{R} \frac{d}{dR}(R^2 \Omega) = 
4 \Omega^2 + 2 \Omega^2 \frac{d \ln \Omega}{d \ln R}
$$

In log scale, the IMF curve is represented by
$$\Phi_{\rm Salpeter}(m) := \frac{dN}{d\log m} = \ln 10 \;m \frac{\dif N}{\dif m}$$
and Salpeter IMF becomes
$$\log \Phi_{\rm Salpeter}(m) = -1.35 \log m + \log (A\ln10).$$

**** Kroupa IMF
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: kroupa-imf
    :END:

The general form of a two-piece IMF could be written as
$$% \phi_{\rm Kroupa}(m) \propto
\phi(m) \propto
\begin{cases}
m^{-\alpha_1} \; &(m < m_1) \\
k \, m^{-\alpha_2} \; &(m > m_1)
\end{cases}$$ The two-piece Kroupa single-star IMF has a lower cutoff at
$0.08
M_\odot$ and $\alpha_1 = 1.3$, $\alpha_2 = 2.3$, $k = 0.5$,
$m_1 = 0.5M_{\odot}$ (Kroupa 2002, see also \cite{Maschberger:2013}.)

To ramdom sample Kroupa IMF, we find the Cumulative Distribution
Function (CDF): $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:2}
  {\rm CDF}(m) \equiv & \int_a^m \phi(m) \dif m \\
  =&
\begin{cases}
  \cfrac{b^{\beta_{1}} - a^{\beta_1}}{\beta_1} \; &(a < m < m_1) \\
  k \cfrac{b^{\beta_{2}} - a^{\beta_2}}{\beta_2} \; &(m_1 < a < m) \\
  \cfrac{m_1^{\beta_{1}} - a^{\beta_1}}{\beta_1} +
  k \cfrac{b^{\beta_{2}} - m_1^{\beta_2}}{\beta_2} \; &(a < m_1 < m).
\end{cases}\end{aligned}$$ where $\beta_1 = 1 - \alpha_1$. With a random
number from 0 to 1, by solving ${\rm CDF}(m) / {\rm
  CDF}(b) = x$ for $m$, one gets a randomly generated mass from the
above distribution function.

In log scale, the Kroupa IMF becomes $$\frac{dN}{d\log{m}} =
  \begin{cases}
    A \cdot \log 10 \, x^{-0.3} & (0.08M_\odot < m < 0.5M_\odot)\\
    A \cdot 0.5 \log 10 \, x^{-1.3} & (0.5M_\odot < m < 100M_\odot)
  \end{cases}$$

*** Virial Theorem

Virial theorem when there is no gas crossing the cloud surce and if the magnetic field at the surface to be a uniform value $B_0$,

$$
\frac{1}{2} \ddot I = 2({\cal T} - {\cal T_S}) + {\cal B} + {\cal W},
$$

with
$$
B = \frac{1}{8\pi} \int_V (B^2 - B_0^2) dV. 
$$

The virial theorem with B field, ${\cal W} + {\cal B} = 0$, is equivalent to the solution to hydrostatic equilibrium. See my derivation [[file:~/Dropbox/Notability2/Container/Virial theorem with B field.pdf][here]].

Lyman--Werner radiation: a strong molecule-destroying Lyman--Werner
(LW) background inhibits effective cooling in low-mass haloes,
delaying star formation until the collapse or more massive
haloes. Only when molecular hydrogen (H2) can self-shield from LW
radiation, which requires a halo capable of cooling by atomic line
emission, will star formation be possible.

X-ray, makes cooling faster.

*** Magnetic fields

*Magnetic critical mass*

Back-of-the-envolope estimation of the magnetic critical mass: set the magnetic energy $(B^2/8\pi) (4\pi/3 R^3)$ equal to the gravitational energy, $| -3GM^2/5R |$ and solve for $M$.
$$
M_\Phi \equiv \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \, \frac{\Phi_B}{3 \pi G^{1/2}} 
$$
where $\Phi_B = \pi R^2 B$ is the magnetic flux and is constant while the cloud contracts (due to flux-freezing).  
For a disk, 3/5 is replaced with 2/3.

(Crutcher 1999)
- If the magnetic field is unimportant throughout the collapse of a spherical cloud, the conservation of magnetic flux implies $B \propto R^{-2}$, while conservation of mass implies $\rho \propto R^{-3}$. Therefore, $B \propto \rho^{2/3}$.
- If the magnetic field is important, clouds must form primarily by flows along field lines, and the clouds will be flattend. Magnetic flux freezing implies $\pi R^2 z \rho / \pi R^2 B = \rho z / B =$ constant, together with Spiter's assumption (Spitzer 1942) that self-garvity is balance only by internal thermal pressure along the symmetry axis, $2\pi G \rho z^2 \approx c_s^2$, this yields $B \propto (\rho T)^{1/2}$. 

*Todo: add 2D phase plot of B-rho from He2021*

*Magnetic braking time*
The magnetic braking time is the time it takes for the magnetic braking to stop the rotation of the disk, or $L/(dL/dt)$, where $L \sim \rho v_\phi R$ and the torque is approximately $F R / V$ which has the dimension of pressure, so $dL/dt \sim B^2$. Therefore, $t_{br} \approx \rho v_\phi R / B^2$.

Due to high temperature in the corona of a star, the pressure in the out layers of a star is much higher than the pressure of interstellar medium, causing the star to lose mass in the form of stellar wind. Actually, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, the asymptotic value of pressure at infinity is much larger than the typical value of the pressure of the interstellar medium. Because of this, Parker (1958) suggested that the solar atmosphere is not in hydrostatic equilibrium but is hydrodynamic and the outer parts of the corona must be expanding in the form of solar wind. Note that solar wind is *thermal* driven. Very massive stars could have radiatively driven wind as well. Red giants often have much stronger winds due to its weak gravity at the surface.

- Stellar wind
	  - Stellar winds are fast moving flows of material (protons, electrons and atoms of heavier metals) that are ejected from stars. These winds are characterised by a continuous outflow of material moving at speeds anywhere between 20 and 2,000 km/s.
	  - Hot, massive stars can produce very strong stellar winds. Over their short lifetimes, they can eject many solar masses (perhaps up to 50% of their initial mass) of material in the form of 2,000 km/sec winds. These stellar winds are driven directly by the radiation pressure from photons escaping the star.

* Stellar Evolution

** Young stellar object

Young stellar object (YSO)

Lada scheme of low-mass stars. Class 0, I, II, and III, distinguished by their spectral energy distribution.

This classification schema roughly reflects evolutionary sequence. It is believed that most deeply embedded Class 0 sources evolve towards Class I stage, dissipating their circumstellar envelopes. Eventually they become optically visible on the stellar birthline as pre-main-sequence stars. Class II objects have circumstellar disks and correspond roughly to classical T Tauri stars, while Class III stars have lost their disks and correspond approximately to weak-line T Tauri stars. An intermediate stage where disks can only be detected at longer wavelengths (e.g., at {\displaystyle 24{\mu }m}{\displaystyle 24{\mu }m}) are known as transition-disk objects. (source: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_stellar_object][wikipedia]])

** Pre-main sequence

Kelvin-Helmhotz (thermal) timescale. The less massive ($< 3 M_\odot$) of them appear as highly variable mass ejecting objects, known as /T Tauri/ stars. 

*** T Tauri Star

T Tauri star is a later phase in a protostar's formation, a class of variable stars that are less than about ten million years old. T Tauri stars are pre-main-sequence stars in the process of contracting to the main sequence along the Hayashi track, a luminosityâtemperature relationship obeyed by infant stars of less than 3 solar masses in the pre-main-sequence phase of stellar evolution. It ends when a star develops a radiative zone, or when a smaller star commences nuclear fusion on the main sequence.

Two classes of GRBs:

- long-soft GRBs
	  - last longer than 2 seconds, soft spectrum.
	  - Models: relativistic jets.
			- First model: the collapsar model of Stan Woosley, or the hypernova
			  model. core-collapse supernovae. A black hole with a debris disk
			  surrounding it form at the center of collapse. "The collimating of
			  the debris disk and associated magnetic fields would lead to a jet
			  emanating from the center of the supernova." (Carroll2007)
			- There is also the top-hat model of the lightcurve.
- short-hard GRBs
	  - last longer than 2 seconds, hard spectrum.
	  - Models: One viable model is the coalescence of compact binary
		systems, in which SHBs are the electromagnetic counterparts of
		strong gravitational-wave sources.

** Supernova

A supernova (plural: supernovae, abbreviations: SN and SNe) is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion. This transient astronomical event occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. See a graph of Supernova classification [[file:~/Dropbox/Notability2/Container/Supernova.pdf][here]]. 

The word supernova was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1929.

*** Type Ia SN

Type Ia SNe are recognised by the silicon absorption line. It is thought that these supernovae originate in binaries consisting of a white dwarf and its companion. Material can flow from the companion to the white dwarf until its mass exceeds the limit (about 1.4 $M_\odot$). Increase of the density and temperature will ignite an explosive fusion reaction that can destroy the white dwarf. The kenetic energy released in the process is of the order of $10^{44}$ J. The origin of the radiation energy is the fission of the radioactive nickel isotope 56 created in the explosion. 

*Type Ia SN as standard candle*: The shape of the lightcurve depends on the brightness of the supernova: the brighter the SN, the broader the top of the lightcurve. Therefore, the maximum brightness of a typer Ia supernova can be determined precisely from its lightcurve. This way they can be used as standard candles to determine dimensions of the universe and cosmological parameters.

*** Type II SN

- *SN 1054 and the Crab Nebula*: SN 1054 is a Type II supernova first observed on July 1054, visible for 2 years. The event was recorded in contemporary Chinese astronomy. The remnant of SN 1054 is known as the /Crab Nebula/.
- *Supernova 1987A*: observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It is a Type II SN. Visible for a while to the unaided eye, it became the closest observable supernova since that of 1604.
