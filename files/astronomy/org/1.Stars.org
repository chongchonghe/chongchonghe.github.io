*** Stellar spectrum types

The Harvard classification scheme of "O B A F G K M" (Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me) is a temperature sequence, running from the hottest blue O stars to the coolest red M stars. Stars nearer the beginning of this sequence are referred to as early-type star, and those closer to the end are called late-type stars. Subdivisions like a K0 star is referred as "early K star".

WR stars are stars with unusual spectra showing prominent broad emission lines of ionised helium and highly ionised nitrogen or carbon. The spectra indicate very high surface enhancement of heavy elements, depletion of hydrogen, and strong stellar winds. They are "bare cores" left over from the peeling of massive stars by stellar winds.

Properties:

- Masses: 8-25 Msun (up to 80 Msun)
- Luminosities: 10^5-6.5 Lsun
- Eddington factor: ~0.7 to ~1.0
- Teff: 3e4 to 1.5e5 K.
- $\dot{M}$: ~5e-6 to 1e-4 Msun/yr
- Lifetime: ~5e5 yr

* Star Formation

** Star Formation: Observations

/Molecular Tracers/.
- *The problem with H$_2$*: The low mass of the hydrogen atom makes the exitation energy very high. This is because the level spacing of a quantum oscillator veries with reduced mass as $m^{-1/2}$. In addition, H2 is homonuclear molecule, so the first level of rotational transition is forbidden, and the second level is 510 K above the ground state.

/Infrared luminosity as a star formation rate tracer./ Underlying assumptions: most of the radiant output in the galaxy comes form young, recently formed stars, and (2) in a dusty galaxy most of the starlight will be absorbed by dust grains within the galaxy and then re-radiated in the infrared. This can be explored using the popular *stellar population synthesis* (SPS) package *Starburst99*.

gas and have key importance for star formation. CO is the major tracor

**** Free fall time

**** Alfven crossing time

The Alfven velocity is given by $v_{{\rm A}}=B_{0}/\sqrt{4\pi\rho_{0}}$ (in cgs). So, $t_{{\rm act}}=L/v_{{\rm A}}=L\sqrt{4\pi\rho_{0}}/B_{0}$.

\end{align}

**** Thermal timescale (Kelvin-Helmholz)

The Kelvin-Helmholz timescale is the time it would take a star to emit its entire reserve of thermal energy upon contracting, assuming a constant luminosity. It is the relevant timescale throughout the protostellar stages.
$$
\tau_{\rm th} \approx \frac{GM^2}{RL} \approx 30~{\rm Myr} \left( \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \right)^2 \left( \frac{R_{\odot}}{R} \right) \left( \frac{L_{\odot}}{L} \right) \sim 30~{\rm Myr} \ \left( \frac{M}{M_{\odot}} \right)^{-2.4}
$$
An important fact is that in only 1/10 of the KH time, the star shrinks to 10 times of the MS radius, and 1/2 of the KH time to 2 times the MS radius. -- CCH

*** Instability

**** Jeans Instability
<<sec:jeans>>

We define the *Jeans length*
$$\lambda_{\rm J} \equiv c_{\rm s} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{G \bar\rho}} = 5.00\,{\rm pc} \; \mu^{-1} T_1^{1/2} n_2^{-1/2} = 172\,{\rm pc} \; \left ( \frac{c_{s}}{1\,\si{km/s}} \right ) \left( \frac{n}{1\,\si{cm^{-3}}} \right)^{-1/2}  $$
# calc: cs = 0.29 km/s, rho = 100 mpcc, cs sqrt(pi / G / rho)
and the Jeans mass [fn:1]
$$M_{\rm J} \equiv \frac{4\pi}{3} \left( \frac{\lambda_{\rm J}}{2}\right)^3 \bar\rho
  = \frac{\pi^{5/2}}{6} \frac{c_{\rm s}^3}{(G^3 \bar\rho)^{1/2}}
  = 52.6~\msun \; \left( \frac{c_s}{0.2~\si{km~s^{-1}}} \right)^3 \left( \mu~n_2 \right)^{-1/2}
  = 160~\msun \, \mu^{-2} T_1^{3/2} n_2^{-1/2}
  = 82~\msun \, T_1^{3/2} n_2^{-1/2} (\mu = 1.4),
  $$
where $n$ is the /particle number density/ and $\mu$ is the /mean particle weight/.
# calc: cs = 0.2 km/s, rho = 100 m_p/cm^3, pi^(5/2)/6 * cs^3/(G^3 * rho)^(1/2)
# assuming $\gamma = 5/3$. The $40~\msun$ part has molecular hydrogen and it is copied from Eq. 9.3 of \cite{Mo2010}.

The *Bonnor-Ebert mass* is an equivalent to the Jeans mass in an isothermal sphere in pressure equilibrium with its surrounding, which may be a more appropriate description for molecular clumps and cores. [fn:2]
$$\label{eq:MBE}
  M_{\rm BE} = 1.182 \frac{c_s^3}{(G^3 \rho)^{1/2}} = 0.41 M_{\rm J}$$
Krumholz's notes ("STAR FORMATION IN MOLECULAR CLOUDS", Problem Set 2) [fn:3] has very nice and detailed derivation of the Bonnor-Ebert mass. The idea is that, given a surface pressure $P_s$ and sound speed $c_s$ there exists a maximum mass at which the cloud can be in hydrostatic equilibrium, i.e. $M_{\rm BE}$. This mass is calculated by solving the isothermal *Lane-Emden* equation and find that the total mass achieves maximum when $\rho_c / \rho_s \approx 14.0$.

**** Toomre Instability

The Toomre $Q$ parameter for a disk with Keplerian/flat rotation curve is

\begin{align*}
Q&=\;\cfrac{\Omega c_s}{\pi G \Sigma} ,  \;\; &&{\rm Keplerian}\\
  &=\;\cfrac{\sqrt{2} \Omega c_s}{\pi G \Sigma},\;\; &&{\rm flat} \\
  &=\;\cfrac{2 \Omega c_s}{\pi G \Sigma},\;\; &&{\rm rigid}
\end{align*}

assuming the non-thermal velocity dispersion in the disk is subsonic. The disk is unstable when $Q < 1$. More generally, for a differentially rotating disk, $k \Omega$ ($k$ is the constant in front) should be replaced with the epicyclic frequence $\kappa$.

$$
\kappa^2 = \frac{2\Omega}{R} \frac{d}{dR}(R^2 \Omega) =
4 \Omega^2 + 2 \Omega^2 \frac{d \ln \Omega}{d \ln R}

**** Kroupa IMF
    :PROPERTIES:

The general form of a two-piece IMF could be written as
$$% \phi_{\rm Kroupa}(m) \propto
\phi(m) \propto
\begin{cases}
m^{-\alpha_1} \; &(m < m_1) \\
k \, m^{-\alpha_2} \; &(m > m_1)
\end{cases}$$ The two-piece Kroupa single-star IMF has a lower cutoff at
$0.08
M_\odot$ and $\alpha_1 = 1.3$, $\alpha_2 = 2.3$, $k = 0.5$,
$m_1 = 0.5M_{\odot}$ (Kroupa 2002, see also \cite{Maschberger:2013}.)

To ramdom sample Kroupa IMF, we find the Cumulative Distribution
Function (CDF): $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:2}
  {\rm CDF}(m) \equiv & \int_a^m \phi(m) \dif m \\
  =&
\begin{cases}
  \cfrac{b^{\beta_{1}} - a^{\beta_1}}{\beta_1} \; &(a < m < m_1) \\
  k \cfrac{b^{\beta_{2}} - a^{\beta_2}}{\beta_2} \; &(m_1 < a < m) \\
  \cfrac{m_1^{\beta_{1}} - a^{\beta_1}}{\beta_1} +
  k \cfrac{b^{\beta_{2}} - m_1^{\beta_2}}{\beta_2} \; &(a < m_1 < m).
\end{cases}\end{aligned}$$ where $\beta_1 = 1 - \alpha_1$. With a random
number from 0 to 1, by solving ${\rm CDF}(m) / {\rm
  CDF}(b) = x$ for $m$, one gets a randomly generated mass from the
above distribution function.

In log scale, the Kroupa IMF becomes $$\frac{dN}{d\log{m}} =
  \begin{cases}
    A \cdot \log 10 \, x^{-0.3} & (0.08M_\odot < m < 0.5M_\odot)\\
    A \cdot 0.5 \log 10 \, x^{-1.3} & (0.5M_\odot < m < 100M_\odot)
  \end{cases}$$

*** Virial Theorem

Virial theorem when there is no gas crossing the cloud surce and if the magnetic field at the surface to be a uniform value $B_0$,

$$
\frac{1}{2} \ddot I = 2({\cal T} - {\cal T_S}) + {\cal B} + {\cal W},
$$

with
$$
B = \frac{1}{8\pi} \int_V (B^2 - B_0^2) dV.
$$

The virial theorem with B field, ${\cal W} + {\cal B} = 0$, is equivalent to the solution to hydrostatic equilibrium. See my derivation [[file:~/Dropbox/Notability2/Container/Virial theorem with B field.pdf][here]].

emission, will star formation be possible.

*** Magnetic fields

*Magnetic critical mass*

Back-of-the-envolope estimation of the magnetic critical mass: set the magnetic energy $(B^2/8\pi) (4\pi/3 R^3)$ equal to the gravitational energy, $| -3GM^2/5R |$ and solve for $M$.
$$
M_\Phi \equiv \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \, \frac{\Phi_B}{3 \pi G^{1/2}}
$$
where $\Phi_B = \pi R^2 B$ is the magnetic flux and is constant while the cloud contracts (due to flux-freezing).
For a disk, 3/5 is replaced with 2/3.

(Crutcher 1999)
- If the magnetic field is unimportant throughout the collapse of a spherical cloud, the conservation of magnetic flux implies $B \propto R^{-2}$, while conservation of mass implies $\rho \propto R^{-3}$. Therefore, $B \propto \rho^{2/3}$.
- If the magnetic field is important, clouds must form primarily by flows along field lines, and the clouds will be flattend. Magnetic flux freezing implies $\pi R^2 z \rho / \pi R^2 B = \rho z / B =$ constant, together with Spiter's assumption (Spitzer 1942) that self-garvity is balance only by internal thermal pressure along the symmetry axis, $2\pi G \rho z^2 \approx c_s^2$, this yields $B \propto (\rho T)^{1/2}$.

*Todo: add 2D phase plot of B-rho from He2021*

*Magnetic braking time*
The magnetic braking time is the time it takes for the magnetic braking to stop the rotation of the disk, or $L/(dL/dt)$, where $L \sim \rho v_\phi R$ and the torque is approximately $F R / V$ which has the dimension of pressure, so $dL/dt \sim B^2$. Therefore, $t_{br} \approx \rho v_\phi R / B^2$.

Due to high temperature in the corona of a star, the pressure in the out layers of a star is much higher than the pressure of interstellar medium, causing the star to lose mass in the form of stellar wind. Actually, assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, the asymptotic value of pressure at infinity is much larger than the typical value of the pressure of the interstellar medium. Because of this, Parker (1958) suggested that the solar atmosphere is not in hydrostatic equilibrium but is hydrodynamic and the outer parts of the corona must be expanding in the form of solar wind. Note that solar wind is *thermal* driven. Very massive stars could have radiatively driven wind as well. Red giants often have much stronger winds due to its weak gravity at the surface.

- Stellar wind
	  - Stellar winds are fast moving flows of material (protons, electrons and atoms of heavier metals) that are ejected from stars. These winds are characterised by a continuous outflow of material moving at speeds anywhere between 20 and 2,000 km/s.
	  - Hot, massive stars can produce very strong stellar winds. Over their short lifetimes, they can eject many solar masses (perhaps up to 50% of their initial mass) of material in the form of 2,000 km/sec winds. These stellar winds are driven directly by the radiation pressure from photons escaping the star.

* Stellar Evolution

** Young stellar object

Young stellar object (YSO)


Lada scheme of low-mass stars. Class 0, I, II, and III, distinguished by their spectral energy distribution.

This classification schema roughly reflects evolutionary sequence. It is believed that most deeply embedded Class 0 sources evolve towards Class I stage, dissipating their circumstellar envelopes. Eventually they become optically visible on the stellar birthline as pre-main-sequence stars. Class II objects have circumstellar disks and correspond roughly to classical T Tauri stars, while Class III stars have lost their disks and correspond approximately to weak-line T Tauri stars. An intermediate stage where disks can only be detected at longer wavelengths (e.g., at {\displaystyle 24{\mu }m}{\displaystyle 24{\mu }m}) are known as transition-disk objects. (source: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_stellar_object][wikipedia]])

** Pre-main sequence

Kelvin-Helmhotz (thermal) timescale. The less massive ($< 3 M_\odot$) of them appear as highly variable mass ejecting objects, known as /T Tauri/ stars.

*** T Tauri Star

- Pre-main sequence
- Energy coming from contracting due to self-gravity, not from nuclear fusion. They are newly-formed (< 10 million years old) low to intermediate mass stars (< 3 solar masses) with central temperatures too low for nuclear fusion to have started.
- They are surrounded by circumstellar discs, probable sites of planet formaiton.
- T Tauri stars are pre-main-sequence stars in the process of contracting to the main sequence along the Hayashi track, a luminosityâtemperature relationship obeyed by infant stars of less than 3 solar masses in the pre-main-sequence phase of stellar evolution. It ends when a star develops a radiative zone, or when a smaller star commences nuclear fusion on the main sequence.

Two classes of GRBs:

- long-soft GRBs
	  - last longer than 2 seconds, soft spectrum.
	  - Models: relativistic jets.
			- First model: the collapsar model of Stan Woosley, or the hypernova
			  model. core-collapse supernovae. A black hole with a debris disk
			  surrounding it form at the center of collapse. "The collimating of
			  the debris disk and associated magnetic fields would lead to a jet
			  emanating from the center of the supernova." (Carroll2007)
			- There is also the top-hat model of the lightcurve.
- short-hard GRBs
	  - last longer than 2 seconds, hard spectrum.
	  - Models: One viable model is the coalescence of compact binary
		systems, in which SHBs are the electromagnetic counterparts of
		strong gravitational-wave sources.

** Supernova

A supernova (plural: supernovae, abbreviations: SN and SNe) is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion. This transient astronomical event occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion. See a graph of Supernova classification [[file:~/Dropbox/Notability2/Container/Supernova.pdf][here]].

The word supernova was coined by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky in 1929.

*** Type Ia SN

Type Ia SNe are recognised by the silicon absorption line. It is thought that these supernovae originate in binaries consisting of a white dwarf and its companion. Material can flow from the companion to the white dwarf until its mass exceeds the limit (about 1.4 $M_\odot$). Increase of the density and temperature will ignite an explosive fusion reaction that can destroy the white dwarf. The kenetic energy released in the process is of the order of $10^{44}$ J. The origin of the radiation energy is the fission of the radioactive nickel isotope 56 created in the explosion.

*Type Ia SN as standard candle*: The shape of the lightcurve depends on the brightness of the supernova: the brighter the SN, the broader the top of the lightcurve. Therefore, the maximum brightness of a typer Ia supernova can be determined precisely from its lightcurve. This way they can be used as standard candles to determine dimensions of the universe and cosmological parameters.

*** Type II SN

- *SN 1054 and the Crab Nebula*: SN 1054 is a Type II supernova first observed on July 1054, visible for 2 years. The event was recorded in contemporary Chinese astronomy. The remnant of SN 1054 is known as the /Crab Nebula/.
- *Supernova 1987A*: observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It is a Type II SN. Visible for a while to the unaided eye, it became the closest observable supernova since that of 1604.

The Lyman-alpha line is the spectral line of hydrogen from $n=2$ to $n=1$. 1215.67 angstroms, or 10.2 eV.

The recombining hydrogen in HII region generates Lyman-alpha radiation in a rate of about $\frac{2}{3} f_{\rm ion} Q_0$. The Lyman-alpha photons can be resonantly scattered by the small amount of neutral hydrogen.

Escape of Lyman-alpha photons from galaxies therefore requires either very low dust abundances or "breakout" of the ionization front so that, in at least some directions, the H II is not bounded by dusty H I gas.

** Radiative Recombination of Hydrogen
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:recomb
:END:

Case B recombination: optically thick to radiation just above $I_{\rm H}=13.60$ eV, so that ionizing photons emitted during recombination are immediately reabsorbed, creating another ion and free electron by photoionization.

Following Draine Ch 15.1.1, let $Q_{0}$ be the rate of emission of hydrogen-ionizing photons, i.e., $h\nu>I_{{\rm H}}=13.6$ eV. Equating the rates of photoionization and radiative recombination gives the ionization balance equation:

$$Q_{0}=\frac{4\pi}{3}R_{{\rm S}}^{\;3}\,\alpha\,n(H^{+})\,n_{e}.$$

Since $n(H^{+})=n_{e}=n_{H}\equiv n_{0}$, we can solve for the /Stromgren radius/ \citep[][Eq. 15.1 (pg 163)]{Draine:2011}
$$
\label{eq:rs}
  R_{S}\equiv\left(\frac{3Q_{0}}{4\pi\,n_{0}^{\;2}\,\alpha_{B}}\right)^{1/3} = 3.17 \, Q_{49}^{1/3} \, n_2^{-2/3} \, T_4^{0.28}~{\rm pc},
$$
where
$$
\alpha_B(T_e) \approx 2 \times 10^{-13} \left( \frac{T_e}{10^4 {\rm K}} \right)^{-3/4} \, {\rm cm}^3 \, {\rm s}^{-1}.
$$

Draine also talked about other aspects of region, including the mean emission measure, mean free path of an 18 eV photon at $T<50,000$ K, and helium ionization.

** Ionization Time Scales

How long will it take to ionize an region?

$$\tau_{{\rm ioni.}}=\frac{4/3\,\pi R_{{\rm
S}}^{\;3}\,n_{0}}{Q_{0}}=\frac{1}{\alpha_{B}\,n_{0}}=\frac{1.22\times10^{3}\,{\rm
yr}}{n_{2}}.$$
for $T \sim 10^4$ K. The /recombination timescale/ (after the ionizing source turns off) is identical to the ionization timescale. For $n_{0}>0.03\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$, this timescale is shorter than the main-sequence lifetime $\gtrsim$ 5 Myr for a massive star.

     :PROPERTIES:

     :END:

The UV radiation from OB stars in HII regions cause the photoionization of the surrounding ISM. At $T \sim 10^4~{\rm K}$ and $N_e<10^6 {\rm cm^{-3}}$, the luminosity in the H$\alpha$ line is $$L_{{\rm H}\alpha} = 0.450 (h \nu_{{\rm H}\alpha}) \dot{N}_{\rm ion},$$ where $\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$ is the number of ionizing photons emitted per unit time, and since it has to be balanced by recombination rate, $$\dot{N}_{\rm ion} = \alpha_{\rm B} n_pn_eV.$$ The Ly$\alpha$ emission is determined by substracting the Case B recombination coefficient $\alpha_{\rm B}$ by the effective recombination coefficient to 2S. At the same environment as above, $$L_{{\rm Ly}\alpha} = 0.676 h \nu_{{\rm Ly}\alpha} \dot{N}_{\rm ion}.$$ Thus, we can infer the number of OB stars in a HII region by measuring the luminosity in a recombination line, and since OB stars are short lived, their number is directly related to their birth rate. This provides the principle for deriving the star-formation rate in a star-forming region from its recombination line strengths.

Solar metallicity is $Z = 0.0134$ \cite{Asplund2009}, where $Z$ is the heavy element mass fraction. The *metallicity* relative to solar is $$[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}] \equiv \log_{10} \left[ \frac{(N_{\rm Fe}/N_{\rm H})_{\rm star}}{(N_{\rm Fe}/N_H)_{\odot}} \right],$$ Stars with [Fe/H] < 0 are metal-poor relative to the Sun. Metal poor makes stars bluer and metal rich makes stars redder due to line blanketing (metals absorb preferentially blue light) and opacity effect (metals absorb energy from the interior of the star, making red giants "swell up" even more, and give them cooler temperatures.)

* Hydrodynamics

** Hydrodynamic equations

My notes: "Notability::Research:Topics:19. Fluid dynamics"

*Summary*
We introduce a /material derivative/ $D/Dt = \partial/\partial t + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla$. It is the derivative following the gas flow, defined as $D Q / Dt = \frac{Q(t+\delta t, {\bf x} + {\bf v}\delta t) - Q(t, {\bf x})}{\delta t}$. Then, the /Euler equations of fluid/ is easily represented as
\begin{align}
\frac{D \rho}{D t} &= - \rho \nabla \cdot {\bf v} \\
\frac{D {\bf v}}{D t} &= - \frac{\nabla p}{\rho} + {\bf g} \\
\frac{D e}{D t} &= - \frac{\nabla \cdot (p {\bf v})}{\rho}
\end{align}
The first equation, the equation of continuity, can be derived by inspecting a volume of fluid, in which the outflow rate equals the change in mass, and we obtain $\partial \rho / \partial t + \nabla \cdot (\rho {\bf v}) = 0$. The conversion between the two different form can be acheived by using the expansion of $\nabla \cdot (\rho {\bf v})$.

c_s = \sqrt{\frac{kT}{\mu m_{H}}} = 0.29\,\si{km/s} \; \left( \frac{T_1}{\mu} \right)^{1/2} = 9.1\,\si{km/s} \; \left( \frac{T_4}{\mu} \right)^{1/2}

*** Viscosity

*Definition of viscosity*: The fource $F$ acting on the top plate of a fluid is proportional to the gradient of the speed $u$ and the area $A$ of the plate:
$$
F = \mu A \frac{\partial u}{\partial y},
$$
$\mu$ is the /dynamic viscosity/ of the fluid, with units of Pa s (pascal-second). The /kinematic viscosity/ is defined as the ratio fo the viscosity $\mu$ to the fluid density:
$$
\nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho},
$$
with the dimension of $L^2/T$.

*** Reynolds Number
     :PROPERTIES:

$\mathcal{R}=LV/\nu$, where $L$ is the typical length of the object, $V$ is the typical fluid velocity, and $\nu$ is the viscosity of the fluid. Imagine two different fluid flows around two geometrically similar objects. If these two systems have the same Reynolds number, then the flow patterns should be similar. This is called the law of similarity (Reynolds 1883). Systems with low Reynolds number are dominated by viscosity.

There is also the /magnetic Reynolds number/ where the vescosity is replaced with the magnetic diffusivity $\lambda = c^2 / 4 \pi \sigma$. See Sec. 14.2 of of Choudhuri (1998).


* MHD

** MHD

Within the confines of the magnnetohydrodynamics of a single-component condducting fluid, the material effects of electromagnetic fields enter as two terms:
#+begin_quote
Lorentz force per unit volume: ${\bf j} \times {\bf B} / c = (\nabla \times {\bf B}) \times {\bf B} / 4\pi$.\\
Heat production per volume by Ohmic dissipation: $j^2 / \sigma = \eta | \nabla \times {\bf B} |^2 / 4\pi$
#+end_quote

Therefore, the equation of continuity is not changed; the equation of motion has to change by adding a magnetic body force, ${\bf j} \times {\bf B} / \rho c$, where ${\bf j} = (c/4\pi) \nabla \times {\bf B}$  is the electric current density. The energy equation has to add an /Ohmic heating/ term, ${\bf j}^2 / \sigma$
