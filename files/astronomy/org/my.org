** Some common asked questions

*** What is the radiative transfer code used in RAMSES?

*** Cooling function?

?

* Jargons

- **Lyman continuum:** wavelength shorter than 912 Angstroms
- **Lyman break:** a 'break' in the spectrum from a galaxy where Lyman continuum photons are absorbed and can't get through.

* Metallicity

Calculated the metal yields in our simulations following Protinari 1998, Table 10. Solar (Z=0.0134) Asplund ARA\\&A 47:481 (2009).
