*** How do you deal with cooling in the code?

We use well defined prescriptions of cooling function of gas from
various processes:

- cooling in neutral gas (including cooling from carbon, oxygen and dust
  grains (hyperfine lines?))

- cooling in HII region at temperatures above $10^4$ K (including
  recombination radiation, free-free emission, and collisionally excited
  line radiation)

*** Hydro solver?
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: hydro-solver
    :CLASS: unnumbered
    :END:

Solving a group of Euler Equations: system of conservation laws: mass
(continuity equation), momentum (equation of motion), and energy, plus
equation of state ($p = p(\rho, \epsilon)$, and for ideal gas,
$p = (\gamma - 1) \rho \epsilon$.).

- Finite-volume discretization with (second-order) Godunov schemes and
  Riemann solvers.

- Godunov scheme

  - Computes the numerical fluxes using the solution to a Riemann
    problem

  - Riemann problem: the initial state is constant for all negative x,
    and constant for all positive x, and at time t = 0 the wall is
    instantly removed and it is watched what happens.

  - Advantage: produce smooth and stable shock profiles.

- AMR: with a tree-based atat structure allowing recursive grid
  refinements on a cell-by-cell basis.

- Radiative transfer (RT) is performed on the AMR grid with a
  first-order Godunov method using the M1 closure. Moment-based
  approach.
