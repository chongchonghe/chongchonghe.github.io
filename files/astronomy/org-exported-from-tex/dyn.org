** The virial theorem

The virial theorem for one particle is:
$$\av{m\vec{v}\cdot\vec{r}}=0\Rightarrow\av{T}=-\half\av{\vec{F}\cdot\vec{r}} =
\half\av{r\frac{dU}{dr}}= \half n\av{U}\mbox{ if } U=-\frac{k}{r^n}$$
The virial theorem for a collection of particles is:
$$\av{T}=-\half\av{\sum\limits_{\rm particles}\vec{F}_i\cdot\vec{r}_i+
\sum\limits_{\rm pairs}\vec{F}_{ij}\cdot\vec{r}_{ij}}$$ These
propositions can also be written as: $2E_{\rm kin}+E_{\rm pot}=0$.

Virial velocity:
$$v_{\rm vir} = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}} = 6.56\,{\rm km/s}\;\left(\frac{M}{10^4 M_\odot}\right)^{1/2} \left( \frac{R}{1\,{\rm pc}}\right)^{-1/2}

*** Relaxation processes
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: relaxation-processes
    :END:

The relaxation time of a particle system is defined as $t_{\rm relax} =
n_{\rm relax} t_{\rm cross}$, where $t_{\rm cross} = R/v$ is the
crossing time, and $n_{\rm relax}$ is the time it takes for a typical
star to change its velocity by a factor of unity cased by encounters to
the rest of the system, $n_{\rm relax} \approx v/|\Delta v|$. Assuming a
typical speed $v^2 \approx
\frac{GNm}{R}$. $$t_{\rm relax} = \frac{0.1N}{\ln N} t_{\rm cross}.
\label{eq:trelax}$$ In a globular cluster, $N \approx 10^5$, the
crossing time is $t_{\rm cross} \approx 1\,$Myr, and
$t_{\rm relax} \approx 1\,$Gyr. For $N=10^4$
$t_{\rm relax} \approx 100\,$Myr.

A more precise formula is given by (Spitzer 1987): $$\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:7}
t_{rl} &= \frac{v_{rms}^{3}}{15.4 G^{2} m \rho \ln \Lambda} \\
&= \num{3.4e6}~{\rm Myr} \left( \frac{v}{10~\si{km/s}} \right)^{3}
\left( \frac{m}{\msun} \right)^{-1} \left( \frac{\rho}{\msun~{\rm
      pc}^{-3}} \right)^{-1} (\ln \Lambda)^{-1}\end{aligned}$$ where $m$
is the mean stellar mass and $\rho$ is the local density. The value of
the parameter $\Lambda$ is 0.4$N$ for theoretical case (homogeneous and
isotropic) and empirically $\sim
0.11N$ for systems where all stars have the same mass. $\Lambda$ is
considerable smaller for systems with a significant range of stellar
masses. A more convenient formula is the *half-mass relaxation time*
(Spitzer 1969, adapted from \cite{Binney:2008}):

Observations show that Galactic globular clusters have $t_{rh}
\lesssim 10$ Myr.

Encounters drive the evolution of a stellar system by several distinct
mechanisms:

1. *Relaxation*

2. *Equipartition* Collisions tend to produce equipartition of kinetic
   energy: massive stars theat lose kinetic energy fall deeper into the
   gravitational potential well and may increase their kinetic energy as
   a result. Conversely, less massive stars preferentially diffuse
   towards the outer parts of th stellar system.

3. *Escape* The RMS escape speed is twice the RMS speed. In a Maxwellian
   distribution, particles with speeds exceeding twice the RMS speed is
   $\gamma = \num{7.38e-3}$, giving an evaporation time
   $t_{evap} = t_{relax}/\gamma \approx 140 t_{relax}$.

4. *Inelastic encounters* Direct physical collision. The characteristic
   timescale on which a star suffers a collision is given approximately
   by $t_{coll} \approx (n\Sigma v)^{-1}.$ Using a collision
   cross-section $\Sigma = \pi (2 R_{\star})^2$, in terms of the
   crossing time $t_{cross} \approx r/v$, $$\label{eq:1}
   \frac{t_{coll}}{t_{cross}} \approx \frac{r^{2}}{4\pi N r_{\star}^2},$$
   expressing in terms of the relaxation time, $$\label{eq:1}
   \frac{t_{coll}}{t_{relax}} \approx 0.2 \left( \frac{v_{\star}}{v}
   \right)^4 \ln N.$$

5. *Binary formation by triple encounters* The total number of binaries
   formed per relaxation time is only

   $$\label{eq:1}
   \frac{N t_{relax}}{t_{3}} \approx \frac{0.1}{N \ln N}.$$ Since the
   system dissolves after the evaporation time of about $10^2
   t_{relax}$, the rate of binary formation by triple encounters is
   negligible if $N$ is much larger than 10.

6. *Interactions with primordial binaries* Primordial binary stars may
   contain massive binding energy in binaries. For example, A binary
   star consisting of two $1~\msun$ stars with separation $2~R_{\odot}$
   has binding energy of $10^{48}$ erg and 100 such binaries contain as
   much binding energy as the whole cluster of $10^5$ stars.

**** Evaporation and ejection
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: evaporation-and-ejection
     :END:

A single close encounter with another star cna produce a velocity change
comparable with the initial velocities of the two stars, thereby kicking
out one of the stars, a process called *ejection*. The ejection time is
given by $$\label{eq:1}
t_{ej} = - \left( \frac{1}{N} \frac{dN}{dt} \right)^{-1} = \num{1e3}
\ln (\lambda N) t_{rh}.$$ Typical values of the Coulomb logarithm,
$\ln (\lambda N) \approx 10$, $t_{ej}$ is much longer than the
evaporation time due to weak encounters. Hence for most purposes we may
neglect ejection relative to evaporation.

In an isolated single-mass cluster the evaporation rate is given by
$$\label{eq:1}
t_{evap} = \ N (dN/dt)^{-1} = f t_{rh}.$$ where $f\approx 300$ (Spitzer
1987). Core collapse in such clusters occurs after about 16 times the
initial $t_{rh}$; thus we expect that only a few percent of the stars in
a cluster will escape before core collapse. tidal forces from the host
galaxy play a central role in determining the evaporation rate from a
cluster. For clusters with tidal radii and other properties similar to
those observed in Galactic globular clusters, the coefficient f in
equation lies in the range $f \approx 20 -- 60$.

** Dynamical Friction
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: dynamical-friction
   :END:

Consider a body of mass (star) $M$ traveling through a population of
particles of individual mass $m_a \ll M$. The field has a density
$\rho$, total mass $\mathcal{M} \gg M$, and radius $\mathcal{R}$. The
first-order diffusion coefficients can be written as (Eq. 8.7, Galactic
Dynamics, Binney and Tremaine) $$\begin{aligned}
  \frac{\dif \mathbf{v}_M}{\dif t} &= D[\Delta v] \approx \frac{4 \sqrt{2\pi}}{3} G^2 M \rho
  \ln \Lambda \frac{ {\bf v}_M}{\sigma^3} \;\;\; (v_M \; \mathrm{small}).
  \label{eq:dvdt1} \\
  \frac{\dif {\bf v}_M}{\dif t} &= D[\Delta v] \approx 4\pi G^2 M \rho
  \ln \Lambda \frac{{\bf v}_M}{v_M^3} \;\;\; (v_M \; \mathrm{large}).
  \label{eq:dvdt2}\end{aligned}$$ where
$$\Lambda = \frac{b_{\rm max}}{b_{90}} \approx \frac{\cal M}{M} \frac{R_{\rm
  orb}}{\cal R},
  \label{eq:lam}$$ $R_{\rm orb}$ is the orbital radius of the subject
star, and $\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion of the field particles.

** Hydrostatic Equilibrium
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: subsec:HE
   :END:

In hydrostatic equilibrium (HE), the gravitational force of the gas is
balanced by pressure gradients, $$\label{eq:2}
\frac{\dif F}{\dif V} = \boxed{\frac{\dif P}{\dif z} = -\rho g }.$$

**** Isothermal sphere in HE
     :PROPERTIES:
     :CUSTOM_ID: isothermal-sphere-in-he
     :END:

In spherical gravitational field, $$\label{eq:3}
\nabla P(\v{r}) = - \rho(\v{r}) \nabla \Phi(\v{r}),$$ With
$P=k_BT\rho/\mu m_p$ and $\dif \Phi/ \dif r = GM(r)/r^2$, one can solve
for $\rho(r)$. The singular solution is $$\label{eq:4}
\rho(r) = \frac{\sigma^2}{2 \pi Gr^2},$$ where
$\sigma= \left( kT/m \right)^{1/2}$ and the mass enclosed in $r$ is
$M(r) = (2\sigma^2 G)r$.

The pseudo-isothermal non-singular solution has a postulated form
$$\label{eq:5}
\rho(r) = \rho_0 \left[ 1 + (r/r_{c})^2 \right]^{-1}.$$
