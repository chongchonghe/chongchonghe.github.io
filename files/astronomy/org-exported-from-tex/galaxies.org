(Ref: \cite{Mo2010})

The Lyman $\alpha$ forest is the set of absorption lines arising from
the absorption of Ly$\alpha$ resonance photons by neutral hydrogen along
the line-of-sight towards a QSO.

Radiation shorter than the Ly$\alpha$ line at 1215 $\si{\angstrom}$
travels outward from a quasar along its path will eventually be
redshifted to the wavelength of the Ly$\alpha$ line, where the radiation
will excite the electron in a neutral hydrogen atoms from the ground
state to the first level, and be re-emitted by the atom in a random
direction as it decays back to the ground state. Life is not easy with
random access to fake news.
