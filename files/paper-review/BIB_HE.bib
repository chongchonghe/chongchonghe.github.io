	abstract = {UV radiation feedback from young massive stars plays a key role in the evolution of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) by photoevaporating and ejecting the surrounding gas. We conduct a suite of radiation hydrodynamic simulations of star cluster formation in marginally bound, turbulent GMCs, focusing on the effects of photoionization and radiation pressure on regulating the net star formation efficiency (SFE) and cloud lifetime. We find that the net SFE depends primarily on the initial gas surface density, Σ<SUB>0</SUB>, such that the SFE increases from 4% to 51% as Σ<SUB>0</SUB> increases from 13 to 1300  M <SUB>⊙ </SUB>  pc  <SUP>-2</SUP>. Cloud destruction occurs within 2-10 Myr after the onset of radiation feedback, or within 0.6-4.1 freefall times (increasing with Σ<SUB>0</SUB>). Photoevaporation dominates the mass loss in massive, low surface density clouds, but because most photons are absorbed in an ionization-bounded Str{\"o}mgren volume, the photoevaporated gas fraction is proportional to the square root of the SFE. The measured momentum injection due to thermal and radiation pressure forces is proportional to    Σ    <SUB>0</SUB><SUP>-0.74</SUP>, and the ejection of neutrals substantially contributes to the disruption of low mass and/or high surface density clouds. We present semi-analytic models for cloud dispersal mediated by photoevaporation and by dynamical mass ejection, and show that the predicted net SFE and mass loss efficiencies are consistent with the results of our numerical simulations.},

@article{Galli1993,
	abstract = {In a previous paper (Paper I) we presented a perturbative analysis of the collapse of a molecular cloud core threaded by an ordered magnetic field, obtaining a semianalytical solution applicable over a moderate range of temporal and spatial scales. In the present paper we supplement this analysis with a numerical solution of the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations that include the effects of ambipolar diffusion, valid in the region where magnetic effects dominate the dynamics of the collapse. We focus on the formation of a flattened disequilibrium structure ("pseudodisk") around the central protostar. The numerical solution gives dimensionless values for the radius of the pseudodisk as a function of time. Combined with the analytical scaling laws found in Paper I, these results provide in the small time limit a simple power-law expression for the dimensional radius of the pseudodisk as a function of the initial magnetic field B<SUB>0</SUB> and effective sound speed a of the unstable molecular cloud core. We tabulate in nondimensional form the velocity, density, and magnetic fields as functions of the radius, polar angle, and time for two values (χ = 11.3 and ∞) of the ion-neutral coupling constant. We apply the results to the density and magnetic field structures on the astronomically interesting scale of a few hundred to a few thousand AU around protostars with mass in the range 0.57-2.0 M<SUB>sun</SUB>. The resultant magnetic field topology causes us to speculate on the importance of neutral-ion slip, ohmic dissipation, and reconnection in the overall problems of the loss of flux and the isolation of the magnetic fields in the pseudodisk (and smaller centrifugal disk) from their interstellar origins. We conclude by comparing our results with observations of flattened dense structures around young stellar objects in various stages of evolution.},

	abstract = {Globular clusters (GCs) exhibit star-to-star variations in specific elements (e.g., He, C, N, O, Na, Al) that bear the hallmark of high-temperature H-burning. These abundance variations can be observed spectroscopically and also photometrically, with the appropriate choice of filters, due to the changing of spectral features within the band pass. This phenomenon is observed in nearly all of the ancient GCs, although, to date, it has not been found in any massive cluster younger than 2 Gyr. Many scenarios have been suggested to explain this phenomenon, with most invoking multiple epochs of star formation within the cluster; however, all have failed to reproduce various key observations, in particular when a global view of the GC population is taken. We review the state of current observations and outline the successes and failures of each of the main proposed models. The traditional idea of using the stellar ejecta from a first generation of stars to form a second generation of stars, while conceptually straightforward, has failed to reproduce an increasing number of observational constraints. We conclude that the puzzle of multiple populations remains unsolved, hence alternative theories are needed.},

	abstract = {The spectroscopic and photometric signals of the star-to-star abundance variations found in globular clusters seem to be correlated with global parameters like the cluster's metallicity, mass, and age. Understanding this behaviour could bring us closer to the origin of these intriguing abundance spreads. In this work we use deep HST photometry to look for evidence of abundance variations in the main sequence of a young massive cluster NGC 419 (∼10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, ∼1.4 Gyr). Unlike previous studies, here we focus on stars in the same mass range found in old globulars (∼0.75-1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>), where light elements variations are detected. We find no evidence for N abundance variations among these stars in the Un - B and U - B colour-magnitude diagrams of NGC 419. This is at odds with the N variations found in old globulars like 47 Tuc, NGC 6352, and NGC 6637 with similar metallicity to NGC 419. Although the signature of the abundance variations characteristic of old globulars appears to be significantly smaller or absent in this young cluster, we cannot conclude if this effect is mainly driven by its age or its mass.},

	abstract = {Introducing the DRAGON simulation project, we present direct N-body simulations of four massive globular clusters (GCs) with 10<SUP>6</SUP> stars and 5 per cent primordial binaries at a high level of accuracy and realism. The GC evolution is computed with NBODY6++GPU and follows the dynamical and stellar evolution of individual stars and binaries, kicks of neutron stars and black holes (BHs), and the effect of a tidal field. We investigate the evolution of the luminous (stellar) and dark (faint stars and stellar remnants) GC components and create mock observations of the simulations (I.e. photometry, colour-magnitude diagrams, surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles). By connecting internal processes to observable features, we highlight the formation of a long-lived `dark' nuclear subsystem made of BHs, which results in a two-component structure. The inner core is dominated by the BH subsystem and experiences a core-collapse phase within the first Gyr. It can be detected in the stellar (luminous) line-of-sight velocity dispersion profiles. The outer extended core - commonly observed in the (luminous) surface brightness profiles - shows no collapse features and is continuously expanding. We demonstrate how a King model fit to observed clusters might help identify the presence of post core-collapse BH subsystems. For global observables like core and half-mass radii, the direct simulations agree well with Monte Carlo models. Variations in the initial mass function can result in significantly different GC properties (e.g. density distributions) driven by varying amounts of early mass-loss and the number of forming BHs.},

	abstract = {We carry out radiation hydrodynamic calculations to study physical processes in the formation of a 1 M<SUB>solar</SUB> protostar. Following our previous work, calculations pursue the whole evolution from the beginning of the first collapse to the end of the main accretion phase. The adiabatic core formed after the initial collapse (i.e., the first core) experiences further gravitational collapse triggered by dissociation of molecular hydrogen, which leads to the formation of the second core, i.e., the birth of a protostar. The protostar grows in mass as accreting the infalling material from the circumstellar envelope, while the protostar keeps its radius at ~4 R<SUB>solar</SUB> during the main accretion phase. These typical features in the evolution are in good agreement with previous studies. We consider two different initial conditions for the density distribution: homogeneous and hydrostatic cloud cores with the same central density of 1.415x10<SUP>-19</SUP> g cm<SUP>-3 </SUP>. The homogeneous core has the total mass of 1 M<SUB>solar</SUB> while the hydrostatic core has 3.852 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. For the initially homogeneous model, the accretion luminosity rapidly rises to the maximum value of 25 L<SUB>solar</SUB> just after the birth of a protostar, and declines gradually as the mass accretion rate decreases. In contrast, the luminosity increases monotonically with time for the initially hydrostatic model. This difference arises because the mass accretion rate varies depending on the inward acceleration at the initial stage, which affects the luminosity curve. A less massive hydrostatic core would possess the similar properties in the luminosity curve to the 3.852 M<SUB>solar</SUB> case, because a hydrostatic cloud core with mass lower than 3.852 M<SUB>solar</SUB> can be shown to provide a smaller mass accretion rate after the birth of a protostar and a more gradual rise in the luminosity curve. Our numerical code is designed to provide the evolution of the spectral energy distribution (SED) along with the dynamical evolution in our spherically symmetric calculations. We confirm that the SED evolves from a 10 K graybody spectrum to hotter spectra typical for class I and flat spectrum sources. The SED for the class 0 sources corresponds to the age of 2x10<SUP>4</SUP> yr, which is smaller by an order of magnitude than the typical age of class I objects. Considering possible nonspherically symmetric effects, we suggest that observed class 0 sources should consist of the ``genuine'' class 0 objects, which are as young as 10<SUP>4</SUP> yr, and more evolved protostars on edge-on view (``class 0-like class I'' objects). The contamination of edge-on class I objects into class 0 sources are not negligible because they are more abundant than genuine class 0 objects. Since observations indicate that the class 0 sources are typically more luminous than class I sources, the initially hydrostatic model, where the luminosity increases monotonically with time, does not match the observations. The initially homogeneous model, in contrast, shows a tendency consistent with the observations. Compiling our results and other theoretical and observational evidence, we illustrate an evolutionary picture of protostar formation. In terms of the evolutionary time and the inclination to an observer, we find that protostellar objects are clearly categorized.},

	abstract = {Dynamical collapse of a molecular cloud core and the formation of a star are investigated by performing radiation hydrodynamic calculations in spherical symmetry. The angle-dependent and frequency-dependent radiative transfer equation is solved without any diffusion approximations, and the evolution of the spectral energy distribution (SED) is examined. <P />In the present paper, as the first step in a series of our work, evolutions before hydrogen molecules begin to dissociate (the so-called first collapse) are examined for different masses and initial temperatures of the parent cloud cores and for different opacities. Numerical results for a typical case [T<SUB>init</SUB> = 10 K and κ<SUB>P</SUB>(10 K) ~ 0.01 cm<SUP>2</SUP> g<SUP>-1</SUP>] show that the radius and mass of the first core are ~5 AU and ~0.05 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively. These values are independent both of the mass of the parent cloud core and of the initial density profile. The analytical expressions for the radius, mass, and accretion luminosity of the first core are also obtained. The SED contains only cold components of a few times 10 K throughout the first collapse phase, because the opaque envelope veils the first core from observers. We suggest that the molecular cloud cores with luminosities higher than ~0.1 L<SUB>⊙</SUB> should contain young protostars deep in the center, even if they show no evidence for the existence of central stars in near-infrared and optical observations.},

@article{Bate2003,
	abstract = {We present results from the largest numerical simulation of star formation to resolve the fragmentation process down to the opacity limit. The simulation follows the collapse and fragmentation of a large-scale turbulent molecular cloud to form a stellar cluster and, simultaneously, the formation of circumstellar discs and binary stars. This large range of scales enables us to predict a wide variety of stellar properties for comparison with observations. <P />The calculation clearly demonstrates that star formation is a highly-dynamic and chaotic process. Star formation occurs in localized bursts within the cloud via the fragmentation both of dense molecular cloud cores and of massive circumstellar discs. Star-disc encounters form binaries and truncate discs. Stellar encounters disrupt bound multiple systems. We find that the observed statistical properties of stars are a natural consequence of star formation in such a dynamical environment. The cloud produces roughly equal numbers of stars and brown dwarfs, with masses down to the opacity limit for fragmentation (~5 Jupiter masses). The initial mass function is consistent with a Salpeter slope (Γ=-1.35) above 0.5 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, a roughly flat distribution (Γ= 0) in the range 0.006-0.5 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, and a sharp cut-off below ~0.005 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. This is consistent with recent observational surveys. The brown dwarfs form by the dynamical ejection of low-mass fragments from dynamically unstable multiple systems before the fragments have been able to accrete to stellar masses. Close binary systems (with separations &lt;~10 au) are not formed by fragmentation in situ. Rather, they are produced by hardening of initially wider multiple systems through a combination of dynamical encounters, gas accretion, and/or the interaction with circumbinary and circumtriple discs. Finally, we find that the majority of circumstellar discs have radii less than 20 au due to truncation in dynamical encounters. This is consistent with observations of the Orion Trapezium cluster and implies that most stars and brown dwarfs do not form large planetary systems.},

@article{Schlegel1998,
	abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 μm map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 μm data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 μm map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H<SUB>2</SUB> in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. <P />To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 μm DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 μm flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 μm map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m<SUP>-2</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP> at 140 μm and of 17 +/- 4 nW m<SUP>-2</SUP> sr<SUP>-1</SUP> at 240 μm (95% confidence). This integrated flux ~2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. <P />The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 μm emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg<SUB>2</SUB> index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

- Core masses and sizes do not depend on either the ionization or upstream magnetic field direction.
- mass-to-flux ratio increase with lower ionization, from twice to four times the critical value. The higher mass-to-flux ratio for low ionization is the result of enhanced transient ambipolar diffusion when the shocked layer first forms.
- Gravitationally critical core masses will depend on the sound speed and mean turbulent pressure in a cloud, regardless of magnetic effects.},

	abstract = {It is established that the formation of rotationally supported disks during the main accretion phase of star formation is suppressed by a moderately strong magnetic field in the ideal MHD limit. Nonideal MHD effects are expected to weaken the magnetic braking, perhaps allowing the disk to reappear. We concentrate on one such effect, ambipolar diffusion, which enables the field lines to slip relative to the bulk neutral matter. We find that the slippage does not sufficiently weaken the braking to allow rotationally supported disks to form for realistic levels of cloud magnetization and cosmic ray ionization rate; in some cases, the magnetic braking is even enhanced. Only in dense cores with both exceptionally weak fields and unreasonably low ionization rate do such disks start to form in our simulations. We conclude that additional processes, such as Ohmic dissipation or Hall effect, are needed to enable disk formation. Alternatively, the disk may form at late times when the massive envelope that anchors the magnetic brake is dissipated, perhaps by a protostellar wind.},

@article{Zhao2021,
	abstract = {Non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects have been shown recently as a robust mechanism of averting the magnetic braking 'catastrophe' and promoting protostellar disc formation. However, the magnetic diffusivities that determine the efficiency of non-ideal MHD effects are highly sensitive to microphysics. We carry out non-ideal MHD simulations to explore the role of microphysics on disc formation and the interplay between ambipolar diffusion (AD) and Hall effect during the protostellar collapse. We find that removing the smallest grain population (≲10 nm) from the standard MRN size distribution is sufficient for enabling disc formation. Further varying the grain sizes can result in either a Hall-dominated or an AD-dominated collapse; both form discs of tens of au in size regardless of the magnetic field polarity. The direction of disc rotation is bimodal in the Hall-dominated collapse but unimodal in the AD-dominated collapse. We also find that AD and Hall effect can operate either with or against each other in both radial and azimuthal directions, yet the combined effect of AD and Hall is to move the magnetic field radially outward relative to the infalling envelope matter. In addition, microphysics and magnetic field polarity can leave profound imprints both on observables (e.g. outflow morphology, disc to stellar mass ratio) and on the magnetic field characteristics of protoplanetary discs. Including Hall effect relaxes the requirements on microphysics for disc formation, so that prestellar cores with cosmic ray ionization rate of ≲2-3 × 10<SUP>-16</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> can still form small discs of ≲10 au radius. We conclude that disc formation should be relatively common for typical prestellar core conditions, and that microphysics in the protostellar envelope is essential to not only disc formation, but also protoplanetary disc evolution.},

@article{Inayoshi2020,
	abstract = {{The existence of {\ensuremath{\sim}}{}10$^{9}$M$_{☉}$ supermassive black
        holes (SMBHs) within the first billion years of the Universe has
        stimulated numerous ideas for the prompt formation and rapid
        growth of black holes (BHs) in the early Universe. Here, we
        review ways in which the seeds of massive BHs may have first
        assembled, how they may have subsequently grown as massive as
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}{}10$^{9}$M$_{☉}$, and how multimessenger
        observations could distinguish between different SMBH assembly
        scenarios. We conclude the following: The ultrarare
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}{}10$^{9}$ M$_{☉}$ SMBHs represent only the
        tip of the iceberg. Early BHs likely fill a continuum from the
        stellar-mass ({\ensuremath{\sim}}10M$_{☉}$) to the supermassive
        ({\ensuremath{\sim}}{}10$^{9}$) regimes, reflecting a range of
        initial masses and growth histories. Stellar-mass BHs were
        likely left behind by the first generation of stars at redshifts
        as high as {\ensuremath{\sim}}30, but their initial growth
        typically was stunted due to the shallow potential wells of
        their host galaxies. Conditions in some larger, metal-poor
        galaxies soon became conducive to the rapid formation and growth
        of massive seed holes, via gas accretion and by mergers in dense
        stellar clusters. BH masses depend on the environment (such as
        the number and properties of nearby radiation sources and the
        local baryonic streaming velocity) and on the metal enrichment
        and assembly history of the host galaxy. Distinguishing between
        assembly mechanisms will be difficult, but a combination of
        observations by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (probing
        massive BH growth via mergers) and by deep multiwavelength
        electromagnetic observations (probing growth via gas accretion)
        is particularly promising.}},

	abstract = {We present radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of star formation         in self-gravitating, turbulent molecular clouds, modelling the         formation of individual massive stars, including their UV         radiation feedback. The set of simulations have cloud masses         between m$_{gas}$ = {}10$^{3}$ M$_{☉}$ and 3 {\texttimes}         {}10$^{5}$ M$_{☉}$ and gas densities typical of clouds in the         local Universe (\textbackslashoverline\{n\}\_gas         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 1.8{\texttimes} 10\^2 cm$^{-3}$) and         10{\texttimes} and 100{\texttimes} denser, expected to exist in         high-redshift galaxies. The main results are as follows. (i) The         observed Salpeter power-law slope and normalization of the         stellar initial mass function at the high-mass end can be         reproduced if we assume that each star-forming gas clump (sink         particle) fragments into stars producing on average a maximum         stellar mass about 40\{\{ per cent\}\} of the mass of the sink         particle, while the remaining 60\{\{ per cent\}\} is distributed         into smaller mass stars. Assuming that the sinks fragment         according to a power-law mass function flatter than Salpeter,         with log-slope 0.8, satisfy this empirical prescription. (ii)         The star formation law that best describes our set of simulation         is d{\ensuremath{\rho}} \_*/dt {\ensuremath{\propto}}         {\ensuremath{\rho}} \_gas\^\{1.5\} if         \textbackslashoverline\{n\}\_gas\&lt;         n\_cri{\ensuremath{\approx}} 10\^3 cm$^{-3}$, and         d{\ensuremath{\rho}} \_*/dt {\ensuremath{\propto}}         {\ensuremath{\rho}} \_gas\^\{2.5\} otherwise. The duration of         the star formation episode is roughly six cloud's sound crossing         times (with c$_{s}$ = 10 km s$^{-1}$). (iii) The total star         formation efficiency in the cloud is f\_*=2\{\{ per cent\}\}         (m\_gas/10\^4 M\_\textbackslashodot)\^\{0.4\}(1+\textbackslashov         erline\{n\}\_gas/n\_cri)\^\{0.91\}, for gas at solar         metallicity, while for metallicity Z \&lt; 0.1 Z$_{☉}$, based on         our limited sample, f$_{*}$ is reduced by a factor of         {\ensuremath{\sim}}5. (iv) The most compact and massive clouds         appear to form globular cluster progenitors, in the sense that         star clusters remain gravitationally bound after the gas has         been expelled.},

In these simulations,         presented in He et al., the formation of individual massive         stars is well resolved, and their UV radiation feedback and         lifetime on the main sequence are modelled self-consistently. We         find that the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from         molecular clouds, \&lt; f\_esc\^\{MC\}\&gt; , decreases with         increasing mass of the star cluster and with decreasing         compactness. Molecular clouds with densities typically found in         the local Universe have negligible \&lt; f\_esc\^\{MC\}\&gt; ,         ranging between 0.5 per cent and 5 per cent. 10 times denser         molecular clouds have \&lt; f\_esc\^\{MC\}\&gt;         {\ensuremath{\approx}} 10 per cent-20 per cent, while         100{\texttimes} denser clouds, which produce globular cluster         progenitors, have \&lt; f\_esc\^\{MC\}\&gt;         {\ensuremath{\approx}} 20 per cent-60 per cent. We find that         \&lt; f\_esc\^\{MC\}\&gt; increases with decreasing gas         metallicity, even when ignoring dust extinction, due to stronger         radiation feedback. However, the total number of escaping         ionizing photons decreases with decreasing metallicity because         the star formation efficiency is reduced. We conclude that the         sources of reionization at z \&gt; 6 must have been very compact         star clusters forming in molecular clouds about 100{\texttimes}         denser than in today's Universe, which lead to a significant         production of old globular clusters progenitors.},

	abstract = {We present a new set of analytic models for the expansion of H II         regions powered by ultraviolet (UV) photoionization from massive         stars and compare them to a new suite of radiative         magnetohydrodynamic simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating         molecular clouds. To perform these simulations, we use RAMSES-         RT, a Eulerian adaptive mesh magnetohydrodynamics code with         radiative transfer of UV photons. Our analytic models         successfully predict the global behaviour of the H II region         provided the density and velocity structure of the cloud are         known. We give estimates for the H II region behaviour based on         a power-law fit to the density field assuming that the system is         virialized. We give a radius at which the ionization front         should stop expanding (`stall'). If this radius is smaller than         the distance to the edge of the cloud, the H II region will be         trapped by the cloud. This effect is more severe in collapsing         clouds than in virialized clouds, since the density in the         former increases dramatically over time, with much larger photon         emission rates needed for the H II region to escape a collapsing         cloud. We also measure the response of Jeans unstable gas to the         H II regions to predict the impact of UV radiation on star         formation in the cloud. We find that the mass in unstable gas         can be explained by a model in which the clouds are evaporated         by UV photons, suggesting that the net feedback on star         formation should be negative.},

	abstract = {Molecular cloud structure is regulated by stellar feedback in various         forms. Two of the most important feedback processes are UV         photoionization and supernovae from massive stars. However, the         precise response of the cloud to these processes, and the         interaction between them, remains an open question. In         particular, we wish to know under which conditions the cloud can         be dispersed by feedback, which, in turn, can give us hints as         to how feedback regulates the star formation inside the cloud.         We perform a suite of radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations         of a {}10$^{5}$ solar mass cloud with embedded sources of         ionizing radiation and supernovae, including multiple supernovae         and a hypernova model. A UV source corresponding to 10 per cent         of the mass of the cloud is required to disperse the cloud,         suggesting that the star formation efficiency should be of the         order of 10 per cent. A single supernova is unable to         significantly affect the evolution of the cloud. However,         energetic hypernovae and multiple supernovae are able to add         significant quantities of momentum to the cloud, approximately         {}10$^{43}$ g cm s$^{-1}$ of momentum per {}10$^{51}$ erg of         supernova energy. We argue that supernovae alone are unable to         regulate star formation in molecular clouds. We stress the         importance of ram pressure from turbulence in regulating         feedback in molecular clouds.},

We then compute both         observationally motivated and theoretically motivated star         formation efficiencies (SFEs) for these simulated clouds. By         including ionizing radiation, we can reproduce the observed SFEs         in the clouds most similar to nearby Milky Way clouds. For         denser clouds, the SFE can approach unity. These observed SFEs         are typically 3 to 10 times larger than the `total' SFEs, I.e.         the fraction of the initial cloud mass converted into stars.         Converting observed into total SFEs is non-trivial. We suggest         some techniques for doing so, though estimate up to a factor of         10 error in the conversion.},

	abstract = {We derive an analytical theory of the prestellar core initial mass         function (IMF) based on an extension of the Press-Schechter         statistical formalism. Our approach relies on the general         concept of the gravothermal and gravoturbulent collapse of a         molecular cloud, with a selection criterion based on the thermal         or turbulent Jeans mass, which yields the derivation of the mass         spectrum of self-gravitating objects in a quiescent or a         turbulent environment. The same formalism also yields the mass         spectrum of non-self-gravitating clumps produced in supersonic         flows. The mass spectrum of the self-gravitating cores         reproduces well the observed IMF. The theory predicts that the         shape of the IMF results from two competing contributions,         namely, a power law at large scales and an exponential cutoff         (lognormal form) centered around the characteristic mass for         gravitational collapse. The cutoff exists both in the case of         thermal or turbulent collapse, provided that the underlying         density field has a lognormal distribution. Whereas pure thermal         collapse produces a power-law tail steeper than the Salpeter         value, dN/dlog M propto M$^{-x}$ with x simeq 1.35, the latter         is recovered exactly for the (three-dimensional) value of the         spectral index of the velocity power spectrum, n simeq 3.8,         found in observations and in numerical simulations of isothermal         supersonic turbulence. Indeed, the theory predicts that x = (n +         1)/(2n - 4) for self-gravitating structures and x = 2 - n'/3 for         non-self-gravitating structures, where n$^{'}$ is the power         spectrum index of log {\ensuremath{\rho}} . We show that,         whereas supersonic turbulence promotes the formation of both         massive stars and brown dwarfs, it has an overall negative         impact on star formation, decreasing the star formation         efficiency. This theory provides a novel theoretical foundation         to understand the origin of the IMF and provides useful guidance         to numerical simulations exploring star formation, while making         testable predictions.},

	abstract = {Recently, Hennebelle and Chabrier derived an analytical theory for the         mass spectrum of non-self-gravitating clumps associated with         overdensities in molecular clouds and for the initial mass         function (IMF) of gravitationally bound prestellar cores, as         produced by the turbulent collapse of the cloud. In this         companion paper, we examine the effects of the nonisothermality         of the flow, of the turbulence forcing and of local fluctuation         of the velocity dispersion, on the mass function. In particular,         we investigate the influence of a polytropic equation of state         (eos) and of the effective adiabatic exponent         {\ensuremath{\gamma}} and find that it has a drastic influence         on the low-mass part of the IMF. We also consider a barotropic         eos (i.e., a piecewise polytropic eos) that mimics the thermal         behavior of the molecular gas and compare the prediction of our         theory with the results of numerical simulations and with the         observationally derived IMF, for cloud parameters which satisfy         Larson-type relations. We find that for clouds whose density is,         at all scales, almost an order of magnitude larger than the         density inferred for the CO clumps in the Galaxy, a good         agreement is obtained between the theory and the observed IMF,         suggesting that star formation preferentially occurs in high-         density environments. We derive an analytical expression for the         IMF which generalizes the expression previously obtained for the         isothermal case. This easy-to-implement analytical IMF should         serve as a template to compare observational or numerical         results with the theory.},

	abstract = {We present an analytical determination of the star formation rate (SFR)         in molecular clouds, based on a time-dependent extension of our         analytical theory of the stellar initial mass function. The         theory yields SFRs in good agreement with observations,         suggesting that turbulence is the dominant, initial process         responsible for star formation. In contrast to previous SFR         theories, the present one does not invoke an ad hoc density         threshold for star formation; instead, the SFR continuously         increases with gas density, naturally yielding two different         characteristic regimes, thus two different slopes in the SFR         versus gas density relationship, in agreement with observational         determinations. Besides the complete SFR derivation, we also         provide a simplified expression, which reproduces the complete         calculations reasonably well and can easily be used for quick         determinations of SFRs in cloud environments. A key property at         the heart of both our complete and simplified theory is that the         SFR involves a density-dependent dynamical time, characteristic         of each collapsing (prestellar) overdense region in the cloud,         instead of one single mean or critical freefall timescale.         Unfortunately, the SFR also depends on some ill-determined         parameters, such as the core-to-star mass conversion efficiency         and the crossing timescale. Although we provide estimates for         these parameters, their uncertainty hampers a precise         quantitative determination of the SFR, within less than a factor         of a few.},

	abstract = {The present paper extends our previous theory of the stellar initial         mass function (IMF) by including time dependence and by         including the impact of the magnetic field. The predicted mass         spectra are similar to the time-independent ones with slightly         shallower slopes at large masses and peak locations shifted         toward smaller masses by a factor of a few. Assuming that star-         forming clumps follow Larson-type relations, we obtain core mass         functions in good agreement with the observationally derived         IMF, in particular, when taking into account the thermodynamics         of the gas. The time-dependent theory directly yields an         analytical expression for the star formation rate (SFR) at cloud         scales. The SFR values agree well with the observational         determinations of various Galactic molecular clouds.         Furthermore, we show that the SFR does not simply depend         linearly on density, as is sometimes claimed in the literature,         but also depends strongly on the clump mass/size, which yields         the observed scatter. We stress, however, that any SFR theory         depends, explicitly or implicitly, on very uncertain assumptions         like clump boundaries or the mass of the most massive stars that         can form in a given clump, making the final determinations         uncertain by a factor of a few. Finally, we derive a fully time         dependent model for the IMF by considering a clump, or a         distribution of clumps accreting at a constant rate and thus         whose physical properties evolve with time. In spite of its         simplicity, this model reproduces reasonably well various         features observed in numerical simulations of converging flows.         Based on this general theory, we present a paradigm for star         formation and the IMF.},

Each GPU has         thousands of computing cores, making them ideally suited to the         task of tracing independent rays. This ray-tracing         implementation is speed competitive with approximate momentum         methods, even with thousands of ionization sources, without         sacrificing accuracy and resolution. Here, we validate our         implementation with the selection of tests presented in the         `cosmological radiative transfer codes comparison project,' to         demonstrate the correct behaviour of the code. We also present a         selection of benchmarks to demonstrate the performance and         computational scaling of the code. As expected, our method         scales linearly with the number of sources and with the square         of the dimension of the 3D computational grid. Our current         implementation is scalable to an arbitrary number of nodes         possessing GPUs, but is limited to a uniform resolution 3D grid.         Cosmological simulations of reionization with tens of thousands         of radiation sources and intergalactic volumes sampled with         {}1024$^{3}$ grid points take about 30 days on 64 GPUs to reach         complete reionization.},

	abstract = {We present semi-analytic models of the epoch of reionization focusing on         the differences between continuous and bursty star formation         (SF). Our model utilizes physically motivated analytic fits to         1D radiative transfer simulations of H II regions around dark         matter haloes in a representative cosmic volume. Constraining         our simulations with observed and extrapolated UV luminosity         functions of high-redshift galaxies, we find that for a fixed         halo mass, stellar populations forming in bursty models produce         larger H II regions which leave behind long-lived relic H II         regions which are able to maintain partial ionization in the         intergalactic medium (IGM) in a manner similar to an early X-ray         background. The overall effect is a significant increase in the         optical depth of the IGM, {\ensuremath{\tau}}$_{e}$, and a         milder increase of the redshift of reionization. To produce         {\ensuremath{\tau}}$_{e}$ = 0.066 observed by Planck and         complete reionization by redshift z$_{re}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}}         6, models with bursty SF require an escape fraction f$_{esc}$         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2-10 per cent that is 2-10 times lower than         f$_{esc}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 17 per cent found assuming         continuous SF and is consistent with upper limits on f$_{esc}$         from observations at z = 0 and z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 1.3-6. The         ionizing photon budget needed to reproduce the observed         {\ensuremath{\tau}}$_{e}$ and z$_{re}$ depends on the period and         duty cycle of the bursts of SF and the temperature of the         neutral IGM. These results suggest that any remaining tension         between observed and predicted ionizing photon budget for         reionization can be alleviated if reionization is driven by         short bursts of SF, perhaps relating to the formation of         Population III stars and compact star clusters such as         protoglobular clusters.},

@article{Hopkins2012,
	abstract = {The interstellar medium (ISM) is governed by supersonic turbulence on a         range of scales. We use this simple fact to develop a rigorous         excursion-set model for the formation, structure and time         evolution of dense gas structures [e.g. giant molecular clouds         (GMCs), massive clumps and cores]. Supersonic turbulence drives         the density distribution in non-self-gravitating regions to a         lognormal with dispersion increasing with Mach number. We         generalize this to include scales {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}h (the         disc scale-height), and use it to construct the statistical         properties of the density field smoothed on a scale R. We then         compare conditions for self-gravitating collapse including         thermal, turbulent and rotational (disc shear) support (reducing         to the Jeans/Toomre criterion on small/large scales). We show         that this becomes a well-defined barrier crossing problem. As         such, an exact 'bound object mass function' can be derived, from         scales of the sonic length to well above the disc Jeans mass.         This agrees remarkably well with observed GMC mass functions in         the Milky Way and other galaxies, with the only inputs being the         total mass and size of the galaxies (to normalize the model).         This explains the cut-off of the mass function and its power-law         slope (close to, but slightly shallower than, -2). The model         also predicts the linewidth-size and size-mass relations of         clouds and the dependence of residuals from these relations on         mean surface density/pressure, in excellent agreement with         observations. We use this to predict the spatial correlation         function/clustering of clouds and, by extension, star clusters;         these also agree well with observations. We predict the         size/mass function of 'bubbles' or 'holes' in the ISM, and show         that this can account for the observed H I hole distribution         without requiring any local feedback/heating sources. We         generalize the model to construct time-dependent         'merger/fragmentation trees' which can be used to follow cloud         evolution and construct semi-analytic models for the ISM, GMCs         and star-forming populations. We provide explicit recipes to         construct these trees. We use a simple example to show that if         clouds are not destroyed in {\ensuremath{\sim}}1-5 crossing         times, then all the ISM mass would be trapped in collapsing         objects even if the large-scale turbulent cascade were         maintained.},

	abstract = {Hennebelle \&amp; Chabrierattempted to derive the stellar initial mass         function (IMF) as a consequence of lognormal density         fluctuations in a turbulent medium, using an argument similar to         Press \&amp; Schechter for Gaussian random fields. Like that         example, however, the solution there does not resolve the         'cloud-in-cloud' problem; it also does not extend to the large         scales that dominate the velocity and density fluctuations. In         principle, these can change the results at the order-of-         magnitude level or more. In this paper, we use the results from         Hopkins to generalize the excursion set formalism and derive the         exact solution in this regime. We argue that the stellar IMF and         core mass function (CMF) should be associated with the last-         crossing distribution, i.e. the mass spectrum of bound objects         defined on the smallest scale on which they are self-         gravitating. This differs from the first-crossing distribution         (mass function on the largest self-gravitating scale) which is         defined in cosmological applications and which, Hopkins shows,         corresponds to the giant molecular cloud (GMC) mass function in         discs. We derive an analytic equation for the last-crossing         distribution that can be applied for an arbitrary collapse         threshold shape in interstellar medium and cosmological studies.         With this, we show that the same model that predicts the GMC         mass function and large-scale structure of galaxy discs also         predicts the CMF - and by extrapolation stellar IMF - in good         agreement with observations. The only adjustable parameter in         the model is the turbulent velocity power spectrum, which in the         range ? gives similar results. We also use this to formally         justify why the approximate solution in Hennebelle \&amp;         Chabrier is reasonable (up to a normalization constant) over the         mass range of the CMF/IMF; however, there are significant         corrections at intermediate and high masses. We discuss how the         exact solutions here can be used to predict additional         quantities such as the clustering of stars, and embedded into         time-dependent models that follow density fluctuations,         fragmentation, mergers and successive generations of star         formation.},

	abstract = {Radiative feedback is an important consequence of cluster formation in         giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in which newly formed clusters         heat and ionize their surrounding gas. The process of cluster         formation, and the role of radiative feedback, has not been         fully explored in different GMC environments. We present a suite         of simulations which explore how the initial gravitational         boundedness, and radiative feedback, affect cluster formation.         We model the early evolution (\&lt;5 Myr) of turbulent,         {}10$^{6}$ M$_{☉}$ clouds with virial parameters ranging from         0.5 to 5. To model cluster formation, we use cluster sink         particles, coupled to a raytracing scheme, and a custom subgrid         model which populates a cluster via sampling an initial mass         function (IMF) with an efficiency of 20 per cent per free-fall         time. We find that radiative feedback only decreases the cluster         particle formation efficiency by a few per cent. The initial         virial parameter plays a much stronger role in limiting cluster         formation, with a spread of cluster formation efficiencies of         37-71 per cent for the most unbound to the most bound model. The         total number of clusters increases while the maximum mass         cluster decreases with an increasing initial virial parameter,         resulting in steeper mass distributions. The star formation         rates in our cluster particles are initially consistent with         observations but rise to higher values at late times. This         suggests that radiative feedback alone is not responsible for         dispersing a GMC over the first 5 Myr of cluster formation.},

	abstract = {The process of radiative feedback in giant molecular clouds (GMCs) is an         important mechanism for limiting star cluster formation through         the heating and ionization of the surrounding gas. We explore         the degree to which radiative feedback affects early         ({\ensuremath{\lesssim}}5 Myr) cluster formation in GMCs having         masses that range from {}10$^{4}$ to {}10$^{6}$ M$_{☉}$ using         the flash code. The inclusion of radiative feedback lowers the         efficiency of cluster formation by 20-50 per cent relative to         hydrodynamic simulations. Two models in particular - 5         {\texttimes} {}10$^{4}$ and {}10$^{5}$ M$_{☉}$ - show the         largest suppression of the cluster formation efficiency,         corresponding to a factor of {\ensuremath{\sim}}2. For these         clouds only, the internal energy, a measure of the energy         injected by radiative feedback, exceeds the gravitational         potential for a significant amount of time. We find a clear         relation between the maximum cluster mass, M$_{c,max}$, formed         in a GMC and the mass of the GMC itself, M$_{GMC}$: M$_{c,max}$         {\ensuremath{\propto}} M\_\{GMC\}\^\{0.81\}. This scaling result         suggests that young globular clusters at the necessary scale of         {}10$^{6}$ M$_{☉}$ form within host GMCs of masses near         {\ensuremath{\sim}}5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{7}$ M$_{☉}$. We compare         simulated cluster mass distributions to the observed embedded         cluster mass function [d log (N)/dlog (M) {\ensuremath{\propto}}         M$^{{\ensuremath{\beta}}}$ where {\ensuremath{\beta}} = -1] and         find good agreement ({\ensuremath{\beta}} = -0.99         {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.14) only for simulations including         radiative feedback, indicating this process is important in         controlling the growth of young clusters. However, the high star         formation efficiencies, which range from 16 to 21 per cent, and         high star formation rates compared to locally observed regions         suggest other feedback mechanisms are also important during the         formation and growth of stellar clusters.},

We         characterize the escape fraction, f$_{esc,GMC}$, from a suite of         individual GMC simulations with masses in the range 10$^{4-6}$         M$_{☉}$ using the adaptive-mesh refinement code FLASH. We find         significantly different f$_{esc,GMC}$ depending on the GMC mass         that can reach \&gt;90 per cent in the evolution of 5         {\texttimes} {}10$^{4}$ and {}10$^{5}$ M$_{☉}$ clouds or remain         low at {\ensuremath{\sim}}5 per cent for most of the lifetime of         more massive GMCs. All clouds show fluctuations over short, sub-         Myr time-scales produced by flickering H II regions. We combine         our results to calculate the total escape fraction         (f$_{esc,tot}$) from GMC populations in dwarf starburst and         spiral galaxies by randomly drawing clouds from a GMC mass         distribution (dN/dM {\ensuremath{\propto}}         M$^{{\ensuremath{\alpha}}}$, where {\ensuremath{\alpha}} is         either -1.5 or -2.5) over fixed time intervals. We find typical         f$_{esc,tot}$ values of 8 per cent for both the dwarf and spiral         models. The fluctuations of f$_{esc,tot}$, however, are much         larger for the dwarf models with values as high as 90 per cent.         The photons escaping from the 5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{4}$ and         {}10$^{5}$ M$_{☉}$ GMCs are the dominant contributors to         f$_{esc,tot}$ in all cases. We also show that the accompanying         star formation rates (SFRs) of our model ({\ensuremath{\sim}}2         {\texttimes} 10$^{-2}$ and 0.73 M$_{☉}$yr$^{-1}$) are consistent         with observations of SFRs in dwarf starburst and spiral         galaxies, respectively.},

	abstract = {Young massive clusters (M {\ensuremath{\geq}} {}10$^{4}$M$_{☉}$) are         proposed modern-day analogues of the globular clusters that were         products of extreme star formation in the early         Universe$^{1-4}$. The exact conditions and mechanisms under         which young massive clusters form remain         unknown$^{4,5}${\textemdash}a fact further complicated by the         extreme radiation fields produced by their numerous young         stars$^{6-9}$. Here, we show that massive clusters are naturally         produced in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of isolated         {}10$^{7}$M$_{☉}$ giant molecular clouds with properties typical         of the local Universe, even under the influence of radiative         feedback. In all cases, these massive clusters grow to globular         cluster masses within 5 million years (Myr) via a roughly equal         combination of filamentary gas accretion and mergers with less         massive clusters. Lowering the heavy-element abundance of the         molecular cloud by a factor of ten reduces the opacity of the         gas and better represents the high-redshift Universe$^{10,11}$.         This results in higher gas accretion, leading to a mass increase         of the largest cluster by a factor of around four. When combined         with simulations of less massive molecular clouds$^{12}$         (10$^{4-6}$M$_{☉}$), a clear relation emerges between the         maximum cluster mass and the mass of the host cloud$^{13}$. Our         results indicate that young massive clusters{\textemdash}and         potentially globular clusters{\textemdash}are simple power-law         extensions of local cluster formation, and are insensitive to         star formation thresholds. A universal picture emerges without         the need for exotic formation scenarios$^{13-15}$.},

	abstract = {The ages of globular clusters in our own Milky Way are known with         precision of about {\ensuremath{\pm}}1 Gyr, hence their         formation history at redshifts z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 3 and         their role in hierarchical cosmology and the reionization of the         intergalactic medium remain relatively undetermined. Here we         analyse the effect of globular cluster formation on the observed         rest-frame UV luminosity functions (LFs) and UV continuum slopes         of high-redshift galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Fields. We         find that the majority of present-day globular clusters have         formed during two distinct epochs: at redshifts z         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2-3 and at redshifts z         {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 6. The birth of proto-GC systems produces         the steep, faint-end slopes of the galaxy LFs and, because the         brightness of proto-GCs fades 5 Myr after their formation, their         blue colours are in excellent agreement with observations. <P         />Our results suggest that: (i) the bulk of the old globular         cluster population with estimated ages {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}12         Gyr (about 50 per cent of the total population) formed in the         relatively massive dwarf galaxies at redshifts z         {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 6; (ii) proto-GC formation was an         important mode of star formation in those dwarf galaxies, and         likely dominated the reionization process. Another consequence         of this scenario is that some of the most massive Milky Way         satellites may be faint and yet undiscovered because tidal         stripping of a dominant GC population precedes significant         stripping of the dark matter haloes of these satellites. This         scenario may alleviate some remaining tensions between cold dark         matter simulations and observations.},

	abstract = {Globular clusters are unique tracers of ancient star formation. We         determine the formation efficiencies of globular clusters across         cosmic time by modelling the formation and dynamical evolution         of the globular cluster population of a Milky Way type galaxy in         hierarchical cosmology, using the merger tree from the Via         Lactea II simulation. All of the models are constrained to         reproduce the observed specific frequency and initial mass         function of globular clusters in isolated dwarfs. Globular         cluster orbits are then computed in a time varying gravitational         potential after they are either accreted from a satellite halo         or formed in situ, within the Milky Way halo. We find that the         Galactocentric distances and metallicity distribution of         globular clusters are very sensitive to the formation         efficiencies of globular clusters as a function of redshift and         halo mass. Our most accurate models reveal two distinct peaks in         the globular cluster formation efficiency at z         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2 and 7-12 and prefer a formation efficiency         that is mildly increasing with decreasing halo mass, the         opposite of what expected for feedback-regulated star formation.         This model accurately reproduces the positions, velocities, mass         function, metallicity distribution, and age distribution of         globular clusters in the Milky Way and predicts that         {\ensuremath{\sim}}40 per cent formed in situ, within the Milky         Way halo, while the other {\ensuremath{\sim}}60 per cent were         accreted from about 20 satellite dwarf galaxies with v$_{cir}$         \&gt; 30 km s$^{-1}$, and about 29 per cent of all globular         clusters formed at redshifts z \&gt; 7. These results further         strengthen the notion that globular cluster formation was an         important mode of star formation in high-redshift galaxies and         likely played a significant role in the reionization of the         intergalactic medium.},

	abstract = {We study how runaway stellar collisions in high-redshift, metal-poor         star clusters form very massive stars (VMSs) that can directly         collapse to intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We follow the         evolution of a pair of neighbouring high-redshift mini-haloes         with high-resolution, cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in         simulations using the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES         combined with the non-equilibrium chemistry package KROME. The         first collapsing mini-halo is assumed to enrich the central         nuclear star cluster (NSC) of the other to a critical         metallicity, sufficient for Population II (Pop. II) star         formation at redshift z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 27. Using the         spatial configuration of the flattened, asymmetrical gas cloud         forming in the core of the metal-enriched halo, we set the         initial conditions for simulations of an initially non-spherical         star cluster with the direct summation code NBODY6 which are         compared to about 2000 NBODY6 simulations of spherical star         clusters for a wide range of star cluster parameters. The final         mass of the VMS that forms depends strongly on the initial mass         and initial central density of the NSC. For the initial central         densities suggested by our RAMSES simulations, VMSs with mass         \&gt;400 M$_{☉}$ can form in clusters with stellar masses of         {\ensuremath{\approx}}{}10$^{4}$ M$_{☉}$, and this can increase         to well over 1000 M$_{☉}$ for more massive and denser clusters.         The high probability we find for forming a VMS in these mini-         haloes at such an early cosmic time makes collisional runaway of         Pop. II star clusters a promising channel for producing large         numbers of high-redshift IMBHs that may act as the seeds of         supermassive black holes.},

	abstract = {We present an implementation of an adaptive ray-tracing (ART) module in         the Athena hydrodynamics code that accurately and efficiently         handles the radiative transfer involving multiple point sources         on a three-dimensional Cartesian grid. We adopt a recently         proposed parallel algorithm that uses nonblocking, asynchronous         MPI communications to accelerate transport of rays across the         computational domain. We validate our implementation through         several standard test problems, including the propagation of         radiation in vacuum and the expansions of various types of H II         regions. Additionally, scaling tests show that the cost of a         full ray trace per source remains comparable to that of the         hydrodynamics update on up to {\ensuremath{\sim}} \{10\}$^{3}$         processors. To demonstrate application of our ART         implementation, we perform a simulation of star cluster         formation in a marginally bound, turbulent cloud, finding that         its star formation efficiency is 12\% when both radiation         pressure forces and photoionization by UV radiation are treated.         We directly compare the radiation forces computed from the ART         scheme with those from the M$_{1}$ closure relation. Although         the ART and M$_{1}$ schemes yield similar results on large         scales, the latter is unable to resolve the radiation field         accurately near individual point sources.},

	abstract = {Reionization in the early Universe is likely driven by dwarf galaxies.         Using cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we study         star formation and the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons         from mini-haloes with \{M\_halo\}{\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 10\^8         \{M\_\{☉\}\}. Our simulations include a new thermo-turbulent         star formation model, non-equilibrium chemistry and relevant         stellar feedback processes (photoionization by young massive         stars, radiation pressure and mechanical supernova explosions).         We find that feedback reduces star formation very efficiently in         mini-haloes, resulting in the stellar mass consistent with the         slope and normalization reported in Kimm \&amp; Cen and the         empirical stellar mass-to-halo mass relation derived in the         local Universe. Because star formation is stochastic and         dominated by a few gas clumps, the escape fraction in mini-         haloes is generally determined by radiation feedback (heating         due to photoionization), rather than supernova explosions. We         also find that the photon number-weighted mean escape fraction         in mini-haloes is higher ({\ensuremath{\sim}}20-40 per cent)         than that in atomic-cooling haloes, although the instantaneous         fraction in individual haloes varies significantly. The escape         fraction from Pop III stars is found to be significant (         {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 10 per cent) only when the mass is         greater than {\ensuremath{\sim}}100 M$_{☉}$. Based on simple         analytic calculations, we show that LyC photons from mini-haloes         are, despite their high escape fractions, of minor importance         for reionization due to inefficient star formation. We confirm         previous claims that stars in atomic-cooling haloes with masses         10\^8 \{M\_\{☉\}\}{\ensuremath{\lesssim}}         \{M\_halo\}{\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 10\^\{11\} \{M\_\{☉\}\} are         likely to be the most important source of reionization.},

	abstract = {Understanding the escape of Lyman continuum (LyC) and Lyman alpha         (Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}}) photons from molecular clouds is one         of the keys to constraining the reionization history of the         Universe. Using a set of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we         investigate how photons propagate and escape from turbulent         clouds with different masses, star formation efficiencies         (SFEs), and metallicities, as well as with different models of         stellar spectra and supernova feedback. We find that the escape         fractions in both LyC and Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} are generally         increasing with time if the cloud is efficiently dispersed by         radiation and supernova feedback. When the total SFE is low (1         per cent of the cloud mass), 0.1-5\{\{ per cent\}\} of LyC         photons leave the metal-poor cloud, whereas the fractions         increase to 20-70\{\{ per cent\}\} in clouds with a 10 per cent         SFE. LyC photons escape more efficiently if gas metallicity is         lower, if the upper mass limit in the stellar initial mass         function is higher, if binary interactions are allowed in the         evolution of stars, or if additional strong radiation pressure,         such as Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} pressure, is present. The escape         fractions of Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} photons are systemically         higher (60-80\{\{ per cent\}\}) than those of LyC photons,         despite large optical depths at line centre         ({\ensuremath{\tau}}$_{0}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}}         {}10$^{6}$-{}10$^{9}$). Scattering of Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}}         photons is already significant on cloud scales, leading to         double-peaked profiles with peak separations of         v\_sep{\ensuremath{\sim}} 400 \{\{km s\^\{-1\}\}\} during the         initial stage of the cloud evolution, while it becomes narrower         than v\_sep {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 150 \{\{km s\^\{-1\}\}\} in         the LyC bright phase. Comparisons with observations of low-         redshift galaxies suggest that Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} photons         require further interactions with neutral hydrogen to reproduce         their velocity offset for a given LyC escape fraction.},

Simulations starting         with supersonic velocity fluctuations develop sink mass         functions with a high-mass power-law tail dN/d log M         {\ensuremath{\propto}} M$^{{\ensuremath{\Gamma}}}$,         {\ensuremath{\Gamma}} = -1 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.1, independent         of the initial Mach number of the velocity field. Similar         results but with weaker statistical significance hold for a         simulation starting with initial density fluctuations. This mass         function power-law dependence agrees with the asymptotic limit         found by Zinnecker assuming Bondi-Hoyle-Littleton (BHL)         accretion, even though the mass accretion rates of individual         sinks show significant departures from the predicted         dot\{M\}{\ensuremath{\propto}} M\^2 behaviour. While BHL         accretion is not strictly applicable due to the complexity of         the environment, we argue that the final mass functions are the         result of a relative M$^{2}$ dependence resulting from         gravitationally focused accretion. Our simulations may show the         power-law mass function particularly clearly compared with         others because our adoption of an isothermal equation of state         limits the effects of thermal physics in producing a broad         initial fragmentation spectrum; {\ensuremath{\Gamma}}         {\textrightarrow} -1 is an asymptotic limit found only when sink         masses grow well beyond their initial values. While we have         purposely eliminated many additional physical processes         (radiative transfer, feedback) which can affect the stellar mass         function, our results emphasize the importance of gravitational         focusing for massive star formation.},

We see strong evidence of absorption         of the spectrum of the quasar redwards of the Lyman         {\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission line (the Gunn-Peterson damping         wing), as would be expected if a significant amount (more than         10 per cent) of the hydrogen in the intergalactic medium         surrounding J1342{\,}+{\,}0928 is neutral. We derive such a         significant fraction of neutral hydrogen, although the exact         fraction depends on the modelling.

We repeat         the previous hydrodynamical star cluster formation simulations         of Bate et al. and Bate \&amp; Bonnell, but we use a realistic         gas equation of state and radiative transfer in the flux-limited         diffusion approximation rather than the original barotropic         equation of state. Whereas star formation in the barotropic         simulations continued unabated until the simulations stopped, we         find that radiative feedback, even from low-mass stars, were         essentially terminates the production of new objects within low-         mass dense molecular cloud cores after roughly one local         dynamical time. Radiative feedback also dramatically decreases         the propensity of massive circumstellar discs to fragment and         inhibits fragmentation of other dense gas (e.g. filaments) close         to existing protostellar objects. These two effects decrease the         numbers of protostars formed by a factor of         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde4 compared with the original         hydrodynamical simulations using the barotropic equation of         state. In particular, whereas the original simulations produced         more brown dwarfs than stars, the radiative feedback results in         a ratio of stars to brown dwarfs of approximately 5:1, in much         better agreement with observations. Most importantly, we find         that although the characteristic stellar mass in the original         calculations scaled linearly with the initial mean Jeans mass in         the clouds, when radiative feedback is included the         characteristic stellar mass is indistinguishable for the two         calculations, regardless of the initial Jeans mass of the         clouds. We thus propose that the reason the observed initial         mass function appears to be universal in the local Universe is         due to self-regulation of the star formation process by         radiative feedback. We present an analytic argument showing how         a characteristic mass may be derived that is relatively         independent of initial conditions such as the cloud's density.},

The initial conditions are identical to those         of previous barotropic calculations published by Bate, but this         time the calculation is performed using a realistic equation of         state and radiation hydrodynamics. The calculation uses sink         particles to model 183 stars and brown dwarfs, including 28         binaries and 12 higher-order multiple systems, the properties of         which are compared to the results from observational surveys. <P         />We find that the radiation hydrodynamical/sink particle         simulation reproduces many observed stellar properties very         well. In particular, whereas using a barotropic equation of         state produces more brown dwarfs than stars, the inclusion of         radiative feedback results in a stellar mass function and a         ratio of brown dwarfs to stars in good agreement with         observations of Galactic star-forming regions. In addition, many         of the other statistical properties of the stars and brown         dwarfs are in reasonable agreement with observations, including         multiplicity as a function of primary mass, the frequency of         very low mass binaries, and general trends for the mass ratio         and separation distributions of binaries. We also examine the         velocity dispersion of the stars, the distributions of disc         truncation radii due to dynamical interactions, and coplanarity         of orbits and sink particle spins in multiple systems. Overall,         the calculation produces a cluster of stars whose statistical         properties are difficult to distinguish from observed systems,         implying that gravity, hydrodynamics and radiative feedback are         the primary ingredients for determining the origin of the         statistical properties of low-mass stars.},

	abstract = {We report the statistical properties of stars and brown dwarfs obtained         from four radiation hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster         formation that resolve masses down to the opacity limit for         fragmentation. The calculations are identical except for their         dust and gas opacities. Assuming dust opacity is proportional to         metallicity, the calculations span a range of metallicities from         1/100 to 3 times solar, although we emphasize that changing the         metallicity has other thermodynamic effects that the         calculations do not capture (e.g. on the thermal coupling         between gas and dust). All four calculations produce stellar         populations whose statistical properties are difficult to         distinguish from observed stellar systems, and we find no         significant dependence of stellar properties on opacity. The         mass functions and properties of multiple stellar systems are         consistent with each other. However, we find that protostellar         mergers are more common with lower opacities. Combining the         results from the three calculations with the highest opacities,         we obtain a stellar population consisting of more than 500 stars         and brown dwarfs. Many of the statistical properties of this         population are in good agreement with those observed in our         Galaxy, implying that gravity, hydrodynamics, and radiative         feedback may be the primary ingredients for determining the         statistical properties of low-mass stars. However, we do find         indications that the calculations may be slightly too         dissipative. Although further calculations will be required to         understand all of the effects of metallicity on stellar         properties, we conclude that stellar properties are surprisingly         resilient to variations of the dust and gas opacities.},

	abstract = {Summary. We investigate the fates of dense star clusters containing 108         stars. If such systems have evolved to the stage when disruptive         stellar collisions are important, the collisionally liberated         gaseous debris may settle towards the centre. Spitzer and         collaborators suggest that this gas condenses into a population         of new main sequence stars. Such a stellar subsystem commences         an autonomous contraction, at a rate controlled by collisions         among the `new' stars themselves, when it attains a fraction e =         (ellipticity of original cluster) 1/2 of the total cluster mass.         The gas liberated by stellar collisions can no longer recondense         into stars when the concomitant luminosity rises to the         Eddington limit for the subsystem: at this stage the subsystem         must dissolve into an amorphous gas cloud. We discuss possible         evolutionary tracks for the massive object thus formed. For a         cluster of 108 N8 solar-type stars, the maximum fraction of rest         mass energy released before a massive object forms is only 3 x         l0- /7 Before a cluster reaches the stage where stellar         collisions are disruptive, runaway coalescence may already have         led to the build-up of a central massive object. Alternatively,         multiple supernovae could leave a post-coalescence cluster         composed of compact stellar-mass remnants. Such a cluster sheds         most of its members by evaporation before evolving to the stage         where it collapses relativistically, unless sufficient gas is         present to catalyse the contraction by interacting magnetically         or gravitationally with the remnants. Dense star clusters may be         responsible for some of the low4evel manifestations of activity         in galactic nuclei; but they are probably merely precursor         stages of the more spectacular quasar-type phenomena, which         develop after a massive object has formed.},

This bending of light is caused by a strong gravitational field.         We show that, in a Schwarzschild metric, the effect is described         by 1-cos{\ensuremath{\alpha}}=(1-cos{\ensuremath{\psi}})(1-r$_{g         }$/R), where R/r$_{g}$ is the emission radius in Schwarzschild         units. The formula is approximate, and it applies at         R\&gt;=2r$_{g}$ only; however, at these radii it has amazing         accuracy, fully sufficient in many applications. As one         application, we develop a new formulation for the light-bending         effects in pulsars. It reveals the simple character of these         effects and gives their quantitative description with         practically no loss of accuracy (for the typical radius of a         neutron star R=3r$_{g}$ the error is 1\%). The visible fraction         of a star surface is shown to be         S$_{v}$/4{\ensuremath{\pi}}R$^{2}$=[2(1-r$_{g}$/R)]$^{-1}$,         which is 3/4 for R=3r$_{g}$. The instantaneous flux of a pulsar         comes from one or two antipodal polar caps that rotate in the         visible zone. The pulse produced by one blackbody cap is found         to be sinusoidal (light bending impacts the pulse amplitude but         not its shape). When both caps are visible, the pulse shows a         plateau: the variable parts of the antipodal emissions precisely         cancel each other. The pulsed fraction of blackbody emission         with antipodal symmetry has an upper limit         A$_{max}$=(R-2r$_{g}$)/(R+2r$_{g}$). Pulsars with         A\&gt;A$_{max}$ must be asymmetric.},

	abstract = {Recent studies seem to suggest that the stellar initial mass function         (IMF) in early-type galaxies might be different from a classical         Kroupa or Chabrier IMF, I.e. contain a larger fraction of the         total mass in low-mass stars. From a theoretical point of view,         supersonic turbulence has been the subject of interest in many         analytical theories proposing a strong correlation with the         characteristic mass of the core mass function (CMF) in star-         forming regions, and as a consequence with the stellar IMF.         Performing two suites of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)         simulations with different mass resolutions, we aim at testing         the effects of variations in the turbulent properties of a         dense, star-forming molecular cloud on the shape of the system         mass function in different density regimes. While analytical         theories predict a shift of the peak of the CMF towards lower         masses with increasing velocity dispersion of the cloud, we         observe in the low-density regime the opposite trend, with high         Mach numbers giving rise to a top-heavy mass distribution. For         the high-density regime we do not find any trend correlating the         Mach number with the characteristic mass of the resulting IMF,         implying that the dynamics of protostellar accretion discs and         fragmentation on small scales is not strongly affected by         turbulence driven at the scale of the cloud. Furthermore, we         suggest that a significant fraction of dense cores are disrupted         by turbulence before stars can be formed in their interior         through gravitational collapse. Although this particular study         has limitations in its numerical resolution, we suggest that our         results, along with those from other studies, cast doubt on the         turbulent fragmentation models on the IMF that simply map the         CMF to the IMF.},

	abstract = {We consider the possibility that the black-hole (BH) binary detected by         LIGO may be a signature of dark matter. Interestingly enough,         there remains a window for masses 20         M$_{☉}${\ensuremath{\lesssim}}M$_{bh}${\ensuremath{\lesssim}}100         M$_{☉}$ where primordial black holes (PBHs) may constitute the         dark matter. If two BHs in a galactic halo pass sufficiently         close, they radiate enough energy in gravitational waves to         become gravitationally bound. The bound BHs will rapidly spiral         inward due to the emission of gravitational radiation and         ultimately will merge. Uncertainties in the rate for such events         arise from our imprecise knowledge of the phase-space structure         of galactic halos on the smallest scales. Still, reasonable         estimates span a range that overlaps the 2 - 53 Gpc$^{-3}$         yr$^{-1}$ rate estimated from GW150914, thus raising the         possibility that LIGO has detected PBH dark matter. PBH mergers         are likely to be distributed spatially more like dark matter         than luminous matter and have neither optical nor neutrino         counterparts. They may be distinguished from mergers of BHs from         more traditional astrophysical sources through the observed mass         spectrum, their high ellipticities, or their stochastic         gravitational wave background. Next-generation experiments will         be invaluable in performing these tests.},

	abstract = {We present a new sink particle algorithm developed for the adaptive mesh         refinement code RAMSES. Our main addition is the use of a clump         finder to identify density peaks and their associated regions         (the peak patches). This allows us to unambiguously define a         discrete set of dense molecular cores as potential sites for         sink particle formation. Furthermore, we develop a new scheme to         decide if the gas in which a sink could potentially form, is         indeed gravitationally bound and rapidly collapsing. This is         achieved using a general integral form of the virial theorem,         where we use the curvature in the gravitational potential to         correctly account for the background potential. We detail all         the necessary steps to follow the evolution of sink particles in         turbulent molecular cloud simulations, such as sink production,         their trajectory integration, sink merging and finally the gas         accretion rate on to an existing sink. We compare our new recipe         for sink formation to other popular implementations. Statistical         properties such as the sink mass function, the average sink mass         and the sink multiplicity function are used to evaluate the         impact that our new scheme has on accurately predicting         fundamental quantities such as the stellar initial mass function         or the stellar multiplicity function.},

	abstract = {Recent surveys of star-forming regions have shown that most stars, and         probably all massive stars, are born in dense stellar clusters.         The mechanism by which a molecular cloud fragments to form         several hundred to thousands of individual stars has remained         elusive. Here, we use a numerical simulation to follow the         fragmentation of a turbulent molecular cloud, and the subsequent         formation and early evolution of a stellar cluster containing         more than 400 stars. We show that the stellar cluster forms         through the hierarchical fragmentation of a turbulent molecular         cloud. This leads to the formation of many small subclusters,         which interact and merge to form the final stellar cluster. The         hierarchical nature of the cluster formation has serious         implications in terms of the properties of the new-born stars.         The higher number-density of stars in subclusters, compared to a         more uniform distribution arising from a monolithic formation,         results in closer and more frequent dynamical interactions. Such         close interactions can truncate circumstellar discs, harden         existing binaries and potentially liberate a population of         planets. We estimate that at least one-third of all stars, and         most massive stars, suffer such disruptive interactions.},

	abstract = {We investigate the physical processes that lead to the formation of         massive stars. Using a numerical simulation of the formation of         a stellar cluster from a turbulent molecular cloud, we evaluate         the relevant contributions of fragmentation and competitive         accretion in determining the masses of the more massive stars.         We find no correlation between the final mass of a massive star,         and the mass of the clump from which it forms. Instead, we find         that the bulk of the mass of massive stars comes from subsequent         competitive accretion in a clustered environment. In fact, the         majority of this mass infalls on to a pre-existing stellar         cluster. Furthermore, the mass of the most massive star in a         system increases as the system grows in numbers of stars and in         total mass. This arises as the infalling gas is accompanied by         newly formed stars, resulting in a larger cluster around a more         massive star. High-mass stars gain mass as they gain companions,         implying a direct causal relationship between the cluster         formation process and the formation of higher-mass stars         therein.},

	abstract = {We investigate the formation of both clustered and distributed         populations of young stars in a single molecular cloud. We         present a numerical simulation of a {}10$^{4}$ M$_{☉}$         elongated, turbulent, molecular cloud and the formation of over         2500 stars. The stars form both in stellar clusters and in a         distributed mode, which is determined by the local gravitational         binding of the cloud. A density gradient along the major axis of         the cloud produces bound regions that form stellar clusters and         unbound regions that form a more distributed population. The         initial mass function (IMF) also depends on the local         gravitational binding of the cloud with bound regions forming         full IMFs whereas in the unbound, distributed regions the         stellar masses cluster around the local Jeans mass and lack both         the high-mass and the low-mass stars. The overall efficiency of         star formation is {\ensuremath{\approx}} 15 per cent in the         cloud when the calculation is terminated, but varies from less         than 1 per cent in the regions of distributed star formation to         {\ensuremath{\approx}} 40 per cent in regions containing large         stellar clusters. Considering that large-scale surveys are         likely to catch clouds at all evolutionary stages, estimates of         the (time-averaged) star formation efficiency (SFE) for the         giant molecular cloud reported here is only         {\ensuremath{\approx}} 4 per cent. This would lead to the         erroneous conclusion of slow star formation when in fact it is         occurring on a dynamical time-scale.},

The local         divergence, shear and vorticity of the velocity field - the         traditional Oort constants - can be measured based purely on         astrometric measurements and in particular depend linearly on         proper motion and parallax. I use data for 304 267 main-sequence         stars from the Gaia DR1 Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution to         perform a local, precise measurement of the Oort constants at a         typical heliocentric distance of 230 pc. The pattern of proper         motions for these stars clearly displays the expected effects         from differential rotation. I measure the Oort constants to be:         A = 15.3 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, B =         -11.9 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, C = -3.2         {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and K = -3.3         {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.6 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, with no colour         trend over a wide range of stellar populations. These first         confident measurements of C and K clearly demonstrate the         importance of non-axisymmetry for the velocity field of local         stars and they provide strong constraints on non-axisymmetric         models of the Milky Way.},

	abstract = {After stars formed in the early Universe, their ultraviolet light is         expected, eventually, to have penetrated the primordial hydrogen         gas and altered the excitation state of its 21-centimetre         hyperfine line. This alteration would cause the gas to absorb         photons from the cosmic microwave background, producing a         spectral distortion that should be observable today at radio         frequencies of less than 200 megahertz. Here we report the         detection of a flattened absorption profile in the sky-averaged         radio spectrum, which is centred at a frequency of 78 megahertz         and has a best-fitting full-width at half-maximum of 19         megahertz and an amplitude of 0.5 kelvin. The profile is largely         consistent with expectations for the 21-centimetre signal         induced by early stars; however, the best-fitting amplitude of         the profile is more than a factor of two greater than the         largest predictions. This discrepancy suggests that either the         primordial gas was much colder than expected or the background         radiation temperature was hotter than expected. Astrophysical         phenomena (such as radiation from stars and stellar remnants)         are unlikely to account for this discrepancy; of the proposed         extensions to the standard model of cosmology and particle         physics, only cooling of the gas as a result of interactions         between dark matter and baryons seems to explain the observed         amplitude. The low-frequency edge of the observed profile         indicates that stars existed and had produced a background of         Lyman-{\ensuremath{\alpha}} photons by 180{\,}million years         after the Big Bang. The high-frequency edge indicates that the         gas was heated to above the radiation temperature less than         100{\,}million years later.},

	abstract = {Metal-poor globular clusters (GCs) are both numerous and ancient, which         indicates that they may be important contributors to ionizing         radiation in the reionization era. Starting from the observed         number density and stellar mass function of old GCs at z = 0, I         compute the contribution of GCs to ultraviolet luminosity         functions (UVLFs) in the high-redshift Universe (10         {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 4). Even under         absolutely minimal assumptions - no disruption of GCs and no         reduction in GC stellar mass from early times to the present -         GC star formation contributes non-negligibly to the UVLF at         luminosities that are accessible to the Hubble Space Telescope         (HST, M$_{1500}$ {\ensuremath{\approx}} -17). If the stellar         masses of GCs were significantly higher in the past, as is         predicted by most models explaining GC chemical anomalies, then         GCs dominate the UV emission from many galaxies in existing         deep-field observations. On the other hand, it is difficult to         reconcile observed UVLFs with models requiring stellar masses at         birth that exceed present-day stellar masses by more than a         factor of 5. The James Webb Space Telescope will be able to         directly detect individual GCs at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6 in         essentially all bright galaxies, and many galaxies below the         knee of the UVLF, for most of the scenarios considered here. The         properties of a subset of high-redshift sources with -19         {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} M$_{1500}$ {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} -14         in HST lensing fields indicate that they may actually be GCs in         formation.},

	abstract = {Stars form in supersonic turbulent molecular clouds that are self-         gravitating. We present an analytic determination of the star         formation rate (SFR) in a gravoturbulent medium based on the         density probability distribution function of molecular clouds         having a piecewise lognormal (LN) and power-law (PL) form. This         is in contrast to previous analytic SFR models that are governed         primarily by interstellar turbulence, which sets purely LN         density probability distribution functions (PDFs). In the         gravoturbulent SFR model described herein, low-density gas         resides in the LN portion of the PDF. Gas becomes         gravitationally unstable past a critical density         ({\ensuremath{\rho}} $_{crit}$), and the PDF begins to form a         PL. As the collapse of the cloud proceeds, the transitional         density ({\ensuremath{\rho}} $_{ t }$) between the LN and PL         portions of the PDF moves toward lower density while the slope         of the PL ({\ensuremath{\alpha}}) becomes increasingly shallow.         The SFR per free-fall time is calculated via an integral over         the LN from {\ensuremath{\rho}} $_{crit}$ to {\ensuremath{\rho}}         $_{ t }$ and an integral over the PL from {\ensuremath{\rho}}         $_{ t }$ to the maximum density. As {\ensuremath{\alpha}}         becomes shallower, the SFR accelerates beyond the expected         values calculated from an LN density PDF. We show that the star         formation efficiency per free-fall time in observations of local         molecular clouds increases with shallower PDF PL slopes, in         agreement with our model. Our model can explain why star         formation is spatially and temporally variable within a cloud         and why the depletion times observed in local and extragalactic         giant molecular clouds vary. Both star-bursting and quiescent         star-forming systems can be explained without the need to invoke         extreme variations of turbulence in the local interstellar         environment.},

	abstract = {Gravitational wave solutions to Einstein{\textquoteright}s equations and         their generation are examined in D-dimensional flat spacetimes.         First the plane wave solutions are analyzed; then the wave         generation is studied with the solution for the metric tensor         being obtained with the help of retarded D-dimensional         Green{\textquoteright}s functions. Because of the difficulties         in handling the wave tails in odd dimensions we concentrate our         study on even dimensions. We compute the metric quantities in         the wave zone in terms of the energy-momentum tensor at retarded         time. Some special cases of interest are studied. First we study         the slow motion approximation, where the D-dimensional         quadrupole formula is deduced. Within the quadrupole         approximation, we consider two cases of interest: a particle in         circular orbit and a particle falling radially into a higher         dimensional Schwarzschild black hole. Then we turn our attention         to the gravitational radiation emitted during collisions lasting         zero seconds, i.e., hard collisions. We compute the         gravitational energy radiated during the collision of two point         particles, in terms of a cutoff frequency. In the case in which         at least one of the particles is a black hole, we argue that         this cutoff frequency should be close to the lowest         gravitational quasinormal frequency. In this context, we compute         the scalar quasinormal frequencies of higher dimensional         Schwarzschild black holes. Finally, as an interesting new         application of this formalism, we compute the gravitational         energy release during the quantum process of black hole pair         creation. These results might be important in light of the         recent proposal that there may exist extra dimensions in the         Universe, one consequence of which may be black hole creation at         the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.},

	abstract = {Formation of supermassive stars (SMSs) with mass         {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}{}10$^{4}$ M$_{☉}$ is a promising pathway         to seed the formation of supermassive black holes in the early         universe. The so-called direct-collapse (DC) model postulates         that such an SMS forms in a hot gas cloud irradiated by a nearby         star-forming galaxy. We study the DC SMS formation in a fully         cosmological context using three-dimensional radiation         hydrodynamics simulations. We initialize our simulations using         the outputs of the cosmological simulation of Chon et al., where         two DC gas clouds are identified. The long-term evolution over a         hundred thousand years is followed from the formation of embryo         protostars through their growth to SMSs. We show that the         strength of the tidal force by a nearby galaxy determines the         multiplicity of the formed stars and affects the protostellar         growth. In one case, where a collapsing cloud is significantly         stretched by strong tidal force, multiple star-disc systems are         formed via filament fragmentation. Small-scale fragmentation         occurs in each circumstellar disc, and more than 10 stars with         masses of a few {\texttimes}{}10$^{3}$ M$_{☉}$ are finally         formed. Interestingly, about a half of them are found as massive         binary stars. In the other case, the gas cloud collapses nearly         spherically under a relatively weak tidal field, and a single         star-disc system is formed. Only a few SMSs with masses         {\ensuremath{\sim}}{}10$^{4}$ M$_{☉}$ are found already after         evolution of a hundred thousand years, and the SMSs are expected         to grow further by gas accretion and to leave massive black         holes at the end of their lives.},

The Hubble         images of the lensed fields are revealing nJy sources (AB mag         \&gt; 31), the faintest galaxies yet observed. The full program         will transform our understanding of galaxy evolution in the         first 600 million years (z \&gt; 9). Previous programs have         yielded a dozen or so z \&gt; 9 candidates, including perhaps         fewer than expected in the Ultra Deep Field and more than         expected in shallower Hubble images. In this paper, we present         high-redshift (z \&gt; 6) number count predictions for the         Frontier Fields and candidates in three of the first Hubble         images. We show the full Frontier Fields program may yield up to         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde70 z \&gt; 9 candidates         (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde6 per field).

We defer quantitative analysis of the z         \&gt; 9 deficit (including detection completeness estimates) to         future work including additional data. At these redshifts,         cosmic variance (field-to-field variation) is expected to be         significant (greater than {\ensuremath{\pm}}50\%) and include         clustering of early galaxies formed in overdensities.

	abstract = {The large columns of dusty gas enshrouding and fuelling star formation         in young, massive stellar clusters may render such systems         optically thick to radiation well into the infrared. This raises         the prospect that both `direct' radiation pressure produced by         absorption of photons leaving stellar surfaces and `indirect'         radiation pressure from photons absorbed and then re-emitted by         dust grains may be important sources of feedback in such         systems. Here, we evaluate this possibility by deriving the         conditions under which a spheroidal, self-gravitating, mixed         gas-star cloud can avoid catastrophic disruption by the combined         effects of direct and indirect radiation pressure. We show that         radiation pressure sets a maximum star cluster formation         efficiency of {\ensuremath{\in}}$_{max}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.9         at a (very large) gas surface density of \{{\ensuremath{\sim}}         \} 10\^5 M\_\{☉ \} pc$^{-2}$(\{ Z\_\{☉ \}\}/Z)         {\ensuremath{\sim}}eq 20 g cm$^{-2}$(\{ Z\_\{☉ \}\}/Z), but that         gas clouds above this limit undergo significant radiation-driven         expansion during star formation, leading to a maximum stellar         surface density very near this value for all star clusters. Data         on the central surface mass density of compact stellar systems,         while sparse and partly confused by dynamical effects, are         broadly consistent with the existence of a metallicity-dependent         upper limit comparable to this value. Our results imply that         this limit may preclude the formation of the progenitors of         intermediate-mass black holes for systems with Z         {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 0.2 \{ Z\_\{☉ \}\}.},

We show that the volume filling factor         of ionized gas is very different in our simulations from the         result from the case where the central source interacted with an         azimuthally smoothed gas density distribution. As expected, gas         density is the key parameter in determining whether or not         clusters are unbound by photoionizing radiation. Nevertheless,         we find - on account of the acceleration of a small fraction of         the gas to high velocities in the outflows - that the deposition         in the gas of an energy that exceeds the binding energy of the         cluster is not a sufficient criterion for unbinding the bulk of         the cluster mass.},

	abstract = {The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) is a staged experiment         to measure 21 cm emission from the primordial intergalactic         medium (IGM) throughout cosmic reionization (z = 6-12), and to         explore earlier epochs of our Cosmic Dawn (z {\ensuremath{\sim}}         30). During these epochs, early stars and black holes heated and         ionized the IGM, introducing fluctuations in 21 cm emission.         HERA is designed to characterize the evolution of the 21 cm         power spectrum to constrain the timing and morphology of         reionization, the properties of the first galaxies, the         evolution of large-scale structure, and the early sources of         heating. The full HERA instrument will be a 350-element         interferometer in South Africa consisting of 14 m parabolic         dishes observing from 50 to 250 MHz. Currently, 19 dishes have         been deployed on site and the next 18 are under construction.         HERA has been designated as an SKA Precursor instrument. In this         paper, we summarize HERA{\textquoteright}s scientific context         and provide forecasts for its key science results. After         reviewing the current state of the art in foreground mitigation,         we use the delay-spectrum technique to motivate high-level         performance requirements for the HERA instrument. Next, we         present the HERA instrument design, along with the subsystem         specifications that ensure that HERA meets its performance         requirements. Finally, we summarize the schedule and status of         the project. We conclude by suggesting that, given the realities         of foreground contamination, current-generation 21 cm         instruments are approaching their sensitivity limits. HERA is         designed to bring both the sensitivity and the precision to         deliver its primary science on the basis of proven foreground         filtering techniques, while developing new subtraction         techniques to unlock new capabilities. The result will be a         major step toward realizing the widely recognized scientific         potential of 21 cm cosmology.},

	abstract = {The cold molecular gas in contemporary galaxies is structured in         discrete cloud complexes. These giant molecular clouds (GMCs),         with {}10$^{4}$-{}10$^{7}$ solar masses (M$_{☉}$) and radii of         5-100 parsecs, are the seeds of star formation$^{1}$.         Highlighting the molecular gas structure at such small scales in         distant galaxies is observationally challenging. Only a handful         of molecular clouds were reported in two extreme submillimetre         galaxies at high redshift$^{2-4}$. Here we search for GMCs in a         typical Milky Way progenitor at z = 1.036. Using the Atacama         Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we mapped the         CO(4-3) emission of this gravitationally lensed galaxy at high         resolution, reading down to 30 parsecs, which is comparable to         the resolution of CO observations of nearby galaxies$^{5}$. We         identify 17 molecular clouds, characterized by masses, surface         densities and supersonic turbulence all of which are 10-100         times higher than present-day analogues. These properties         question the universality of GMCs$^{6}$ and suggest that GMCs         inherit their properties from ambient interstellar medium. The         measured cloud gas masses are similar to the masses of stellar         clumps seen in the galaxy in comparable numbers$^{7}$. This         corroborates the formation of molecular clouds by fragmentation         of distant turbulent galactic gas disks$^{8,9}$, which then turn         into stellar clumps ubiquitously observed in galaxies at `cosmic         noon' (ref. $^{10}$).},

	abstract = {Physical dust models are presented for 65 galaxies in SINGS that are         strongly detected in the four IRAC bands and three MIPS bands.         For each galaxy we estimate (1) the total dust mass, (2) the         fraction of the dust mass contributed by PAHs, and (3) the         intensity of the starlight heating the dust grains. We find that         spiral galaxies have dust properties resembling the dust in the         local region of the Milky Way, with similar dust-to-gas ratio         and similar PAH abundance. The observed SEDs, including galaxies         with SCUBA photometry, can be reproduced by dust models that do         not require ``cold'' (T\&lt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10         K) dust. The dust-to-gas ratio is observed to be dependent on         metallicity. In the interstellar media of galaxies with         A$_{O}${\ensuremath{\equiv}}12+log10(O/H)\&gt;8.1, grains         contain a substantial fraction of interstellar Mg, Si, and Fe.         Galaxies with A$_{O}$\&lt;8.1 and extended H I envelopes in some         cases appear to have global dust-to-gas ratios that are low for         their measured oxygen abundance, but the dust-to-gas ratio in         the regions where infrared emission is detected generally         appears to be consistent with a substantial fraction of         interstellar Mg, Si, and Fe being contained in dust. The PAH         index q$_{PAH}$, the fraction of the dust mass in the form of         PAHs, correlates with metallicity. The nine galaxies in our         sample with A$_{O}$\&lt;8.1 have a median q$_{PAH}$=1.0\%,         whereas galaxies with A$_{O}$\&gt;8.1 have a median         q$_{PAH}$=3.55\%.

Four distinct mass domains have been         identified, which we have tentatively associated with low,         intermediate, high, and very high mass main-sequence stars, but         which nevertheless are clearly separated by three distinct break         points at 1.05, 2.4, and 7 \{\{M\}$_{☉ }$\} within the studied         mass range of 0.38-32 \{\{M\}$_{☉ }$\}. Further, a revised mass-         luminosity relation (MLR) is found based on linear fits for each         of the mass domains identified. The revised, mass-domain based         MLRs, which are classical (L\textbackslashpropto         \{\{M\}$^{{\ensuremath{\alpha}} }$\}), are shown to be         preferable to a single linear, quadratic, or cubic equation         representing an alternative MLR. Stellar radius evolution within         the main sequence for stars with M\textbackslashgt 1 \{\{M\}$_{☉         }$\} is clearly evident on the M-R diagram, but it is not clear         on the M-\{\{T\}$_{eff}$\} diagram based on published         temperatures. Effective temperatures can be calculated directly         using the well known Stephan-Boltzmann law by employing the         accurately known values of M and R with the newly defined MLRs.         With the calculated temperatures, stellar temperature evolution         within the main sequence for stars with M\textbackslashgt 1         \{\{M\}$_{☉ }$\} is clearly visible on the M-\{\{T\}$_{eff}$\}         diagram. Our study asserts that it is now possible to compute         the effective temperature of a main-sequence star with an         accuracy of {\ensuremath{\sim}}6\%, as long as its observed         radius error is adequately small (\textbackslashlt 1\%) and its         observed mass error is reasonably small (\textbackslashlt 6\%).},

This is a revision of         the j $_{sstarf}$-M $_{sstarf}$ diagram presented in our recent         comprehensive study of galactic angular momentum. In that work,         we estimated j $_{sstarf}$ from kinematic and photometric data         that extended to large radii and M $_{sstarf}$ from near-         infrared luminosities L$_{K}$ with an assumed universal mass-to-         light ratio M $_{sstarf}$/L$_{K}$ . However, recent stellar         population models show large variations in M $_{sstarf}$/L$_{K}$         correlated with B - V color. In the present work, we use this         correlation to estimate M $_{sstarf}$/L$_{K}$ and hence M         $_{sstarf}$ from the measured B - V and L$_{K}$ . Our revised j         $_{sstarf}$-M $_{sstarf}$ diagram is similar to our previous         one; both disk-dominated and elliptical galaxies follow nearly         parallel sequences with j\_\textbackslashstar         \textbackslashpropto M\_\{\textbackslashstar         \}\^\{\textbackslashalpha \} and {\ensuremath{\alpha}} = 0.6         {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.1. However, the offset between the         sequences is now a factor of about 5, some 30\% larger than         before (and close to the offset found by Fall in 1983). Thus,         our new results place even tighter constraints on the loss of         specific angular momentum by galactic disks over their         lifetimes.},

Five are selected as part of         a complete flux-limited sample in the SDSS northern Galactic         cap; two have larger photometric errors and are not part of the         complete sample. One of the new quasars, SDSS J1335+3533         (z=5.93), exhibits no emission lines; the 3         {\ensuremath{\sigma}} limit on the rest-frame equivalent width         of the Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}}+N V line is 5 {\r{A}}. It is the         highest redshift lineless quasar known and could be a         gravitational lensed galaxy, a BL Lac object, or a new type of         quasar. Two new z\&gt;6 quasars, SDSS 1250+3130 (z=6.13) and         SDSS J1137+3549 (z=6.01), show deep Gunn-Peterson absorption         gaps in Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}}. These gaps are narrower than         the complete Gunn-Peterson absorption troughs observed among         quasars at z\&gt;6.2 and do not have complete         Ly{\ensuremath{\beta}} absorption.

	abstract = {We study the initial mass function (IMF) and hosting halo properties of         intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, 10$^{4-6}$ M$_{☉}$) formed         inside metal-free, UV-illuminated atomic-cooling haloes (virial         temperature T$_{vir}$ {\ensuremath{\geq}} {}10$^{4}$ K) either         via the direct collapse of the gas or via an intermediate         supermassive star (SMS) stage. These IMBHs have been recently         advocated as the seeds of the supermassive black holes observed         at z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 6. We achieve this goal in three         steps: (a) we derive the gas accretion rate for a proto-SMS to         undergo General Relativity instability and produce a direct         collapse black hole (DCBH) or to enter the zero-age main         sequence and later collapse into an IMBH; (b) we use merger-tree         simulations to select atomic-cooling haloes in which either a         DCBH or SMS can form and grow, accounting for metal enrichment         and major mergers that halt the growth of the proto-SMS by gas         fragmentation. We derive the properties of the hosting haloes         and the mass distribution of black holes at this stage, and dub         it the `birth mass function'; (c) we follow the further growth         of the DCBH by accreting the leftover gas in the parent halo and         compute the final IMBH mass. We consider two extreme cases in         which minihaloes (T$_{vir}$ \&lt; {}10$^{4}$ K) can (fertile) or         cannot (sterile) form stars and pollute their gas leading to a         different IMBH IMF. In the (fiducial) fertile case, the IMF is         bimodal extending over a broad range of masses, M         {\ensuremath{\approx}} (0.5-20) {\texttimes} {}10$^{5}$ M$_{☉}$,         and the DCBH accretion phase lasts from 10 to 100 Myr. If         minihaloes are sterile, the IMF spans the narrower mass range M         {\ensuremath{\approx}} (1-2.8) {\texttimes} {}10$^{6}$ M$_{☉}$,         and the DCBH accretion phase is more extended (70-120 Myr). We         conclude that a good seeding prescription is to populate haloes         (a) of mass 7.5 \&lt; log (M$_{h}$/ M$_{☉}$) \&lt; 8, (b) in the         redshift range 8 \&lt; z \&lt; 17, (c) with IMBH in the mass         range 4.75 \&lt; (log M$_{{\ensuremath{\bullet}}}$/ M$_{☉}$)         \&lt; 6.25.},

These galaxies were         selected from new deep near-infrared Hubble Space Telescope         imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep         Extragalactic Legacy Survey, Hubble UltraDeep Field 2009, and         Wide Field Camera 3 Early Release Science programs. We         investigate the contribution to reionization from galaxies that         we observe directly, thus sidestepping the uncertainties         inherent in complementary studies that have invoked assumptions         regarding the intrinsic shape or the faint-end cutoff of the         galaxy ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function. Due to our larger         survey volume, wider wavelength coverage, and updated         assumptions about the clumping of gas in the intergalactic         medium (IGM), we find that the observable population of galaxies         can sustain a fully reionized IGM at z = 6, if the average         ionizing photon escape fraction (f $_{esc}$) is         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30\%. Our result contrasts with         a number of previous studies that have measured UV luminosity         densities at these redshifts that vary by a factor of five, with         many concluding that galaxies could not complete reionization by         z = 6 unless a large population of galaxies fainter than the         detection limit were invoked, or extremely high values of f         $_{esc}$ were present. The specific UV luminosity density from         our observed galaxy samples at z = 7 and 8 is not sufficient to         maintain a fully reionized IGM unless f $_{esc}$ \&gt; 50\%. We         examine the contribution from galaxies in different luminosity         ranges and find that the sub-L* galaxies we detect are stronger         contributors to the ionizing photon budget than the L \&gt; L*         population, unless f $_{esc}$ is luminosity dependent. Combining         our observations with constraints on the emission rate of         ionizing photons from Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} forest         observations at z = 6, we find that we can constrain f $_{esc}$         \&lt; 34\% (2{\ensuremath{\sigma}}) if the observed galaxies are         the only contributors to reionization, or \&lt;13\%         (2{\ensuremath{\sigma}}) if the luminosity function extends to a         limiting magnitude of M $_{UV}$ = -13. These escape fractions         are sufficient to sustain an ionized IGM by z = 6. Current         constraints on the high-redshift galaxy population imply that         the volume ionized fraction of the IGM, while consistent with         unity at z \&lt;= 6, appears to drop at redshifts not much         higher than 7, consistent with a number of complementary         reionization probes. If faint galaxies dominated the ionizing         photon budget at z = 6-7, future extremely deep observations         with the James Webb Space Telescope will probe deep enough to         directly observe them, providing an indirect constraint on the         global ionizing photon escape fraction.},

Different MHD Riemann solvers can be used, and the use of the         MUSCL-Hancok approach combines a good accuracy with a fast         exectution of the code.

	abstract = {Recent observations indicate a lower H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} to FUV ratio         in dwarf galaxies than in brighter systems, a trend that could         be explained by a truncated and/or steeper initial mass function         (IMF) in small galaxies. However, at low star formation rates         (SFRs), the H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} to FUV ratio can vary due to         stochastic sampling even for a universal IMF, a hypothesis that         has, prior to this work, received limited investigation. Using         SLUG, a fully stochastic code for synthetic photometry in star         clusters and galaxies, we compare the H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and         FUV luminosity in a sample of         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde450 nearby galaxies with models         drawn from a universal Kroupa IMF and a modified IMF, the         integrated galactic initial mass function (IGIMF). Once random         sampling and time evolution are included, a Kroupa IMF convolved         with the cluster mass function (CMF) reproduces the observed         H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} distribution at all FUV luminosities,         while a truncated IMF as implemented in current IGIMF models         underpredicts the H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} luminosity by more than         an order of magnitude at the lowest SFRs. We conclude that the         observed luminosity is the result of the joint probability         distribution function of the SFR, CMF, and a universal IMF,         consistent with parts of the IGIMF theory, but that a truncation         in the IMF in clusters is inconsistent with the observations.         Future work will examine stochastic star formation and its time         dependence in detail to study whether random sampling can         explain other observations that suggest a varying IMF.},

	abstract = {Most stars in the Galaxy are believed to be formed within star clusters         from collapsing molecular clouds. However, the complete process         of star formation, from the parent cloud to a gas-free star         cluster, is still poorly understood. We perform radiation-         hydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of a turbulent         molecular cloud using the RAMSES-RT code. Stars are modelled         using sink particles, from which we self-consistently follow the         propagation of the ionizing radiation. We study how different         feedback models affect the gas expulsion from the cloud and how         they shape the final properties of the emerging star cluster. We         find that the star formation efficiency is lower for stronger         feedback models. Feedback also changes the high-mass end of the         stellar mass function. Stronger feedback also allows the         establishment of a lower density star cluster, which can         maintain a virial or sub-virial state. In the absence of         feedback, the star formation efficiency is very high, as well as         the final stellar density. As a result, high-energy close         encounters make the cluster evaporate quickly. Other indicators,         such as mass segregation, statistics of multiple systems and         escaping stars confirm this picture. Observations of young star         clusters are in best agreement with our strong feedback         simulation.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed parameter study of collapsing turbulent cloud         cores, varying the initial density profile and the initial         turbulent velocity field. We systematically investigate the         influence of different initial conditions on the star formation         process, mainly focusing on the fragmentation, the number of         formed stars and the resulting mass distributions. Our study         compares four different density profiles (uniform, Bonnor-Ebert         type, {\ensuremath{\rho}}{\ensuremath{\propto}}r$^{-1.5}$ and         {\ensuremath{\rho}}{\ensuremath{\propto}}r$^{-2}$), combined         with six different supersonic turbulent velocity fields         (compressive, mixed and solenoidal, initialized with two         different random seeds each) in three-dimensional simulations         using the adaptive-mesh refinement, hydrodynamics code FLASH.         The simulations show that density profiles with flat cores         produce hundreds of low-mass stars, either distributed         throughout the entire cloud or found in subclusters, depending         on the initial turbulence. Concentrated density profiles always         lead to the formation of one high-mass star in the centre of the         cloud and, if at all, low-mass stars surrounding the central         one. In uniform and Bonnor-Ebert type density distributions,         compressive initial turbulence leads to local collapse about 25         per cent earlier than solenoidal turbulence. However, central         collapse in the steep power-law profiles is too fast for the         turbulence to have any significant influence. We conclude that         (i) the initial density profile and turbulence mainly determine         the cloud evolution and the formation of clusters, (ii) the         initial mass function (IMF) is not universal for all setups and         (iii) that massive stars are much less likely to form in flat         density distributions. The IMFs obtained in the uniform and         Bonnor-Ebert type density profiles are more consistent with the         observed IMF, but shifted to lower masses.},

We find that         magnetic fields thicken the disc by a factor of a few to a scale         height of \{{\ensuremath{\sim}} \}100 pc, delay the formation of         dense (and molecular) gas by \{{\ensuremath{\sim}} \}25 Myr, and         result in differently shaped gas structures. The magnetized gas         fragments into fewer clumps, which are initially at subcritical         mass-to-flux ratios, M/{\ensuremath{\Phi}}         {\ensuremath{\approx}} 0.3(M/{\ensuremath{\Phi}})$_{crit}$, and         accrete gas preferentially parallel to the magnetic field lines         until supercritial mass-to-flux ratios of up to the order of 10         are reached. The accretion rates onto molecular clouds scale         with \textbackslashdot\{M\}{\ensuremath{\propto}} M\^\{1.5\}.         The median of the intercloud velocity dispersion is         \{{\ensuremath{\sim}} \}2-5 km s\^\{-1\} and lower than the         internal velocity dispersion in the clouds         (\{{\ensuremath{\sim}} \}3-7 km s\^\{-1\}). However, individual         cloud-cloud collisions occur at speeds of a few 10 km s\^\{-1\}.},

	abstract = {We present a suite of 3D multiphysics MHD simulations following star         formation in isolated turbulent molecular gas discs ranging from         5 to 500 parsecs in radius. These simulations are designed to         survey the range of surface densities between those typical of         Milky Way giant molecular clouds (GMCs) (\{{\ensuremath{\sim}}         \} 10\^2 \{M\_\{\textbackslashodot \} pc\^\{-2\}\}) and extreme         ultraluminous infrared galaxy environments         (\{{\ensuremath{\sim}} \} 10\^4 \{M\_\{\textbackslashodot \}         pc\^\{-2\}\}) so as to map out the scaling of the cloud-scale         star formation efficiency (SFE) between these two regimes. The         simulations include prescriptions for supernova, stellar wind,         and radiative feedback, which we find to be essential in         determining both the instantaneous per-freefall         ({\ensuremath{\in}}$_{ff}$) and integrated         ({\ensuremath{\in}}$_{int}$) star formation efficiencies. In all         simulations, the gas discs form stars until a critical stellar         surface density has been reached and the remaining gas is blown         out by stellar feedback. We find that surface density is a good         predictor of {\ensuremath{\in}}$_{int}$, as suggested by         analytic force balance arguments from previous works. SFE         eventually saturates to {\ensuremath{\sim}}1 at high surface         density. We also find a proportional relationship between         {\ensuremath{\in}}$_{ff}$ and {\ensuremath{\in}}$_{int}$,         implying that star formation is feedback-moderated even over         very short time-scales in isolated clouds. These results have         implications for star formation in galactic discs, the nature         and fate of nuclear starbursts, and the formation of bound star         clusters. The scaling of {\ensuremath{\in}}$_{ff}$ with surface         density is not consistent with the notion that         {\ensuremath{\in}}$_{ff}$ is always {\ensuremath{\sim}} 1 per         cent on the scale of GMCs, but our predictions recover the         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 1 per cent value for GMC parameters similar         to those found in spiral galaxies, including our own.},

	abstract = {A maximum stellar surface density {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}         \_max{\ensuremath{\sim}} 3 {\texttimes}         10\^5\{M\_\textbackslashodot pc\^\{-2\}\} is observed across all         classes of dense stellar systems (e.g. star clusters, galactic         nuclei, etc.), spanning {\ensuremath{\sim}}8 orders of magnitude         in mass. It has been proposed that this characteristic scale is         set by some dynamical feedback mechanism preventing collapse         beyond a certain surface density. However, simple analytic         models and detailed simulations of star formation moderated by         feedback from massive stars argue that feedback becomes less         efficient at higher surface densities (with the star formation         efficiency increasing as {\ensuremath{\sim}}{\ensuremath{\Sigma}         }/{\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{crit}$). We therefore propose an         alternative model wherein stellar feedback becomes ineffective         at moderating star formation above some         {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{crit}$, so the supply of star-forming         gas is rapidly converted to stars before the system can contract         to higher surface density. We show that such a model - with         {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{crit}$ taken directly from the theory -         naturally predicts the observed {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{max}$.         We find {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{max}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}}         100{\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{crit}$ because the gas consumption         time is longer than the global free-fall time even when feedback         is ineffective. Moreover, the predicted         {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{max}$ is robust to spatial scale and         metallicity, and is preserved even if multiple episodes of star         formation/gas inflow occur. In this context, the observed         {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{max}$ directly tells us where feedback         fails.},

	abstract = {Radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) simulations are used to study many         astrophysical phenomena; however, they require the use of         simplified radiation transport and thermal prescriptions to         reduce computational cost. In this paper, we present a         systematic study of the importance of microphysical processes in         RHD simulations using the example of D-type H II region         expansion. We compare the simplest hydrogen-only models with         those that include: ionization of H, He, C, N, O, S and Ne,         different gas metallicity, non-LTE metal-line-blanketed stellar         spectral models of varying metallicity, radiation pressure, dust         and treatment of photodissociation regions. Each of these         processes is explicitly treated using modern numerical methods         rather than parametrization. In line with expectations, changes         due to microphysics in either the effective number of ionizing         photons or the thermal structure of the gas lead to differences         in D-type expansion. In general, we find that more realistic         calculations lead to the onset of D-type expansion at smaller         radii and a slower subsequent expansion. Simulations of star-         forming regions using simplified microphysics are therefore         likely overestimating the strength of radiative feedback. We         find that both variations in gas metallicity and the inclusion         of dust can affect the ionization front evolution at the 10-20         per cent level over 500 kyr, which could substantially modify         the results of simplified 3D models including feedback. Stellar         metallicity, radiation pressure and the inclusion of         photodissociation regions are all less-significant effects at         the 1 per cent level or less, rendering them of minor importance         in the modelling the dynamical evolution of H II regions.},

We present a simple analytic model of global collapse         onto a filament and compare this with our numerical simulations         of the flow-driven formation of an isolated molecular cloud to         illustrate the supersonic motions and infall ram pressures         expected in models of gravity-driven cloud evolution. We compare         our results with observations of the Pipe Nebula, an especially         suitable object for our purposes as its low star formation         activity implies insignificant perturbations from stellar         feedback. We show that our collapsing cloud model can explain         the magnitude of the velocity dispersions seen in the $^{13}$CO         filamentary structure by Onishi et al. and the ram pressures         required by Lada et al. to confine the lower-mass cores in the         Pipe Nebula. We further conjecture that higher-resolution         simulations will show small velocity dispersions in the densest         core gas, as observed, but which are infall motions and not         supporting turbulence. Our results point out the inevitability         of ram pressures as boundary conditions for molecular cloud         filaments, and the possibility that especially lower-mass cores         still can be accreting mass at significant rates, as suggested         by observations.},

The general requirements for equipartition and the         conditions for various forms of equipartition to hold in         gravitating systems are discussed. A series of computer         simulations based on numerical integrations of the         multicomponent Fokker-Planck equation is described. The results         indicate that even local equipartition can occur temporarily         near the center among all mass species even if the mass spectrum         is very steep. It is also found that the evolved density         distributions are not homologous, in contrast to previous         assumptions, and that only the massive stars can be in         approximate equipartition if the mass spectrum is not very         steep. Therefore the kinetic temperature of most stars, which         determines the structure of globular clusters, may differ from         the temperature of the more readily observable luminous stars.

	abstract = {We investigate the impact of radiation pressure on spatial dust         distribution inside H II regions using one-dimensional radiation         hydrodynamic simulations, which include absorption and re-         emission of photons by dust. In order to investigate grain-size         effects as well, we introduce two additional fluid components         describing large and small dust grains in the simulations.         Relative velocity between dust and gas strongly depends on the         drag force. We include collisional drag force and coulomb drag         force. We find that, in a compact H II region, a dust cavity         region is formed by radiation pressure. Resulting dust cavity         sizes ({\ensuremath{\sim}}0.2 pc) agree with observational         estimates reasonably well. Since dust inside an H II region is         strongly charged, relative velocity between dust and gas is         mainly determined by the coulomb drag force. Strength of the         coulomb drag force is about 2 order of magnitude larger than         that of the collisional drag force. In addition, in a cloud of         mass {}10$^{5}$ M$_{☉}$, we find that the radiation pressure         changes the grain-size distribution inside H II regions. Since         large (0.1 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) dust grains are accelerated more         efficiently than small (0.01 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) grains, the         large-to-small grain mass ratio becomes smaller by an order of         magnitude compared with the initial one. Resulting dust-size         distributions depend on the luminosity of the radiation source.         The large and small grain segregation becomes weaker when we         assume stronger radiation source, since dust grain charges         become larger under stronger radiation and hence coulomb drag         force becomes stronger.},

We have simulated the formation         of three star clusters from the gravitational collapse of         molecular clouds whose densities vary by a factor of a hundred.         As with previous calculations including radiative feedback, we         find that the dependence of the characteristic stellar mass,         M$_{c}$, on the initial mean density of the cloud,         {\ensuremath{\rho}}, is weaker than the dependence of the         thermal Jeans mass. However, unlike previous calculations, which         found no statistically significant variation in the median mass         with density, we find a weak dependence approximately of the         form M$_{c}$ {\ensuremath{\propto}}         {\ensuremath{\rho}}$^{-1/5}$. The distributions of properties of         multiple systems do not vary significantly between the         calculations. We compare our results to the result of         observational surveys of star-forming regions and suggest that         the similarities between the properties of our lowest density         calculation and the nearby Taurus-Auriga region indicate that         the apparent excess of solar-type stars observed may be due to         the region's low density.},

	abstract = {LIGO's discovery of a gravitational wave from two merging black holes         (BHs) of similar masses rekindled suggestions that primordial         BHs (PBHs) make up the dark matter (DM). If so, PBHs would add a         Poissonian isocurvature density fluctuation component to the         inflation-produced adiabatic density fluctuations. For LIGO's BH         parameters, this extra component would dominate the small-scale         power responsible for collapse of early DM halos at z         {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 10, where first luminous sources formed.         We quantify the resultant increase in high-z abundances of         collapsed halos that are suitable for producing the first         generation of stars and luminous sources. The significantly         increased abundance of the early halos would naturally explain         the observed source-subtracted near-IR cosmic infrared         background (CIB) fluctuations, which cannot be accounted for by         known galaxy populations. For LIGO's BH parameters, this         increase is such that the observed CIB fluctuation levels at 2-5         {\ensuremath{\mu}}m can be produced if only a tiny fraction of         baryons in the collapsed DM halos forms luminous sources. Gas         accretion onto these PBHs in collapsed halos, where first stars         should also form, would straightforwardly account for the         observed high coherence between the CIB and unresolved cosmic         X-ray background in soft X-rays. We discuss modifications         possibly required in the processes of first star formation if         LIGO-type BHs indeed make up the bulk or all of DM. The         arguments are valid only if the PBHs make up all, or at least         most, of DM, but at the same time the mechanism appears         inevitable if DM is made of PBHs.},

	abstract = {Whether or not molecular clouds and embedded cloud fragments are stable         against collapse is of utmost importance for the study of the         star formation process. Only ``supercritical'' cloud fragments         are able to collapse and form stars. The virial parameter         {\ensuremath{\alpha}} = M $_{vir}$/M, which compares the virial         mass to the actual mass, provides one way to gauge stability         against collapse. Supercritical cloud fragments are         characterized by {\ensuremath{\alpha}}         \&lt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2, as indicated by a         comprehensive stability analysis considering perturbations in         pressure and density gradients. Past research has suggested that         virial parameters {\ensuremath{\alpha}}         \&gt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2 prevail in clouds. This         would suggest that collapse toward star formation is a gradual         and relatively slow process and that magnetic fields are not         needed to explain the observed cloud structure. Here, we review         a range of very recent observational studies that derive virial         parameters Lt2 and compile a catalog of 1325 virial parameter         estimates. Low values of {\ensuremath{\alpha}} are in particular         observed for regions of high-mass star formation (HMSF). These         observations may argue for a more rapid and violent evolution         during collapse. This would enable ``competitive accretion'' in         HMSF, constrain some models of ``monolithic collapse,'' and         might explain the absence of high-mass starless cores.         Alternatively, the data could point at the presence of         significant magnetic fields \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1 mG         at high gas densities. We examine to what extent the derived         observational properties might be biased by observational or         theoretical uncertainties. For a wide range of reasonable         parameters, our conclusions appear to be robust with respect to         such biases.},

The shape of the signal suggests that the spin temperature of         neutral hydrogen was coupled to the kinetic temperature of the         gas relatively rapidly (19 {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} z         {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 21). We therefore consider models in         which the ultraviolet photons were dominantly produced in the         rarest and most massive halos (M {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}         {}10$^{9}$ M $_{☉}$), as their abundance grows fast enough at         those redshifts to account for this feature of the signal.

	abstract = {Using our cosmological radiative transfer code, we study the         implications of the updated quasi-stellar object (QSO)         emissivity and star formation history for the escape fraction         (f$_{esc}$) of hydrogen ionizing photons from galaxies. We         estimate the f$_{esc}$ that is required to reionize the Universe         and to maintain the ionization state of the intergalactic medium         in the post-reionization era. At z \&gt; 5.5, we show that a         constant f$_{esc}$ of 0.14-0.22 is sufficient to reionize the         Universe. At z \&lt; 3.5, consistent with various observations,         we find that f$_{esc}$ can have values from 0 to 0.05. However,         a steep rise in f$_{esc}$, of at least a factor of         {\ensuremath{\sim}}3, is required between z = 3.5 and 5.5. It         results from a rapidly decreasing QSO emissivity at z \&gt; 3         together with a nearly constant measured H I photoionization         rates at 3 \&lt; z \&lt; 5. We show that this requirement of a         steep rise in f$_{esc}$ over a very short time can be relaxed if         we consider the contribution from a recently found large number         density of faint QSOs at z {\ensuremath{\geq}} 4. In addition, a         simple extrapolation of the contribution of such QSOs to high-z         suggests that QSOs alone can reionize the Universe. This         implies, at z \&gt; 3.5, that either the properties of galaxies         should evolve rapidly to increase the f$_{esc}$ or most of the         low-mass galaxies should host massive black holes and sustain         accretion over a prolonged period. These results motivate a         careful investigation of theoretical predictions of these         alternate scenarios that can be distinguished using future         observations. Moreover, it is also very important to revisit the         measurements of H I photoionization rates that are crucial to         the analysis presented here.},

	abstract = {Star formation is intimately linked to the dynamical evolution of         molecular clouds. Turbulent fragmentation determines where and         when protostellar cores form, and how they contract and grow in         mass via competitive accretion from the surrounding cloud         material. This process is investigated using numerical models of         self-gravitating molecular cloud dynamics, where no turbulent         support is included, where turbulence is allowed to decay         freely, and where it is continuously replenished on large,         intermediate, and small scales, respectively. Molecular cloud         regions without turbulent driving sources, or where turbulence         is driven on large scales, exhibit rapid and efficient star         formation in a clustered mode, whereas interstellar turbulence         that carries most energy on small scales results in isolated         star formation with low efficiency. The clump-mass spectrum of         shock-generated density fluctuations in non-self-gravitating         hydrodynamic supersonic turbulence is not well fit by a power         law, and it is too steep at the high-mass end to be in agreement         with the observational data. When gravity is included in the         turbulence models, local collapse occurs, and the spectrum         extends toward larger masses as clumps merge together; then a         power-law description         dN/dM\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeM$^{{\ensuremath{\nu}}}$         becomes possible with slope         {\ensuremath{\nu}}\&lt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde-2. In         the case of pure gravitational contraction, i.e., in regions         without turbulent support, the clump-mass spectrum is shallower         with {\ensuremath{\nu}}\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde-3/2. The         mass spectrum of protostellar cores in regions with no turbulent         support and where turbulence is replenished on large scales,         however, is well described by a lognormal or by multiple power         laws, similar to the stellar initial mass function (IMF) at low         and intermediate masses. The model clusters are not massive         enough to allow for comparison with the high-mass part of the         IMF. In the case of small-scale turbulence, the core mass         spectrum is too flat compared to the IMF for all masses.},

	abstract = {We present a new high-resolution N-body algorithm for cosmological         simulations. The algorithm employs a traditional particle-mesh         technique on a cubic grid and successive multilevel relaxations         on the finer meshes, introduced recursively in a fully adaptive         manner in the regions where the density exceeds a predefined         threshold. The mesh is generated to effectively match an         arbitrary geometry of the underlying density field--a property         particularly important for cosmological simulations. In a         simulation the mesh structure is not created at every time step         but is properly adjusted to the evolving particle distribution.         The algorithm is fast and effectively parallel: the         gravitational relaxation solver is approximately half as fast as         the fast Fourier transform solver on the same number of mesh         cells. The required CPU time scales with the number of cells,         N$_{c}$, as \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitildeO(N$_{c}$). The code         allows us to improve considerably the spatial resolution of the         particle-mesh code without loss in mass resolution. We present a         detailed description of the methodology, implementation, and         tests of the code. We further use the code to study the         structure of dark matter halos in high-resolution         (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2 h$^{-1}$ kpc) simulations of         standard CDM ({\ensuremath{\Omega}} = 1, h = 0.5,         {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$ = 0.63) and         {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM         ({\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{{\ensuremath{\Lambda}}}$ = 1 -         {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{0}$ = 0.7, h = 0.7,         {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$ = 1.0) models. We find that halo         density profiles in both CDM and {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM         models are well fitted by the analytical model presented         recently by Navarro et al., which predicts a singular         [{\ensuremath{\rho}}(r) \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde         r$^{-1}$] behavior of the halo density profiles at small radii.         We therefore conclude that halos formed in the         {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM model have structure similar to that         of CDM halos and thus cannot explain the dynamics of the central         parts of dwarf spiral galaxies, as inferred from the galaxies'         rotation curves.},

@article{Kruijssen2011,
	abstract = {The formation and evolution of star cluster populations are related to         the galactic environment. Cluster formation is governed by         processes acting on galactic scales, and star cluster disruption         is driven by the tidal field. In this paper, we present a self-         consistent model for the formation and evolution of star cluster         populations, for which we combine an N-body/smoothed particle         hydrodynamics galaxy evolution code with semi-analytical models         for star cluster evolution. The model includes star formation,         feedback, stellar evolution and star cluster disruption by two-         body relaxation and tidal shocks. The model is validated by a         comparison to N-body simulations of dissolving star clusters. We         apply the model by simulating a suite of nine isolated disc         galaxies and 24 galaxy mergers. The evolutionary histories of         individual clusters in these simulations are discussed to         illustrate how the environment of clusters changes in time and         space. It is found that the variability of the disruption rate         with time and space affects the properties of star cluster         populations. In isolated disc galaxies, the mean age of the         clusters increases with galactocentric radius. The combined         effect of clusters escaping their dense formation sites         ('cluster migration') and the preferential disruption of         clusters residing in dense environments ('natural selection')         implies that the mean disruption rate of the population         decreases with cluster age. This affects the slope of the         cluster age distribution, which becomes a function of the star         formation rate density (star formation rate per unit volume).         The evolutionary histories of clusters in a galaxy merger vary         widely and determine which clusters survive the merger. Clusters         that escape into the stellar halo experience low disruption         rates, while clusters orbiting near the starburst region of a         merger are disrupted on short time-scales due to the high gas         density. This impacts the age distributions and the locations of         the surviving clusters at all times during a merger. The paper         includes a discussion of potential improvements for the model         and a brief exploration of possible applications. We conclude         that accounting for the interplay between the formation,         disruption and orbital histories of clusters enables a more         sophisticated interpretation of observed properties of cluster         populations, thereby extending the role of cluster populations         as tracers of galaxy evolution.},

Our         calculation is based on three premises: (1) star formation         occurs in virialized molecular clouds that are supersonically         turbulent; (2) the density distribution within these clouds is         lognormal, as expected for supersonic isothermal turbulence; and         (3) stars form in any subregion of a cloud that is so overdense         that its gravitational potential energy exceeds the energy in         turbulent motions. We show that a theory based on this model is         consistent with simulations and with the observed star formation         rate in the Milky Way. We use our theory to derive the         Kennicutt-Schmidt law from first principles and make other         predictions that can be tested by future observations. We also         provide an algorithm for estimating the star formation rate that         is suitable for inclusion in numerical simulations.},

@article{Krumholz2011,
	abstract = {One model for the origin of typical Galactic star clusters such as the         Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is that they form via the rapid,         efficient collapse of a bound gas clump within a larger,         gravitationally unbound giant molecular cloud. However,         simulations in support of this scenario have thus far not         included the radiation feedback produced by the stars; radiative         simulations have been limited to significantly smaller or lower-         density regions. Here we use the ORION AMR code to conduct the         first ever radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of the global         collapse scenario for the formation of an ONC-like cluster. We         show that radiative feedback has a dramatic effect on the         evolution: once the first         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10\%-20\% of the gas mass is         incorporated into stars, their radiative feedback raises the gas         temperature high enough to suppress any further fragmentation.         However, gas continues to accrete onto existing stars, and, as a         result, the stellar mass distribution becomes increasingly top-         heavy, eventually rendering it incompatible with the observed         initial mass function (IMF). Systematic variation in the         location of the IMF peak as star formation proceeds is         incompatible with the observed invariance of the IMF between         star clusters, unless some unknown mechanism synchronizes the         IMFs in different clusters by ensuring that star formation is         always truncated when the IMF peak reaches a particular value.         We therefore conclude that the global collapse scenario, at         least in its simplest form, is not compatible with the observed         stellar IMF. We speculate that processes that slow down star         formation, and thus reduce the accretion luminosity, may be able         to resolve the problem.},

	abstract = {Star formation is one of the least understood processes in cosmic         evolution. It is difficult to formulate a general theory for         star formation in part because of the wide range of physical         processes involved. The interstellar gas out of which stars form         is a supersonically turbulent plasma governed by         magnetohydrodynamics. This is hard enough by itself, since we do         not understand even subsonic hydrodynamic turbulence very well,         let alone supersonic non-ideal MHD turbulence. However, the         behavior of star-forming clouds in the ISM is also obviously         influenced by gravity, which adds complexity, and by both         continuum and line radiative processes. Finally, the behavior of         star-forming clouds is influenced by a wide variety of chemical         processes, including formation and destruction of molecules and         dust grains (which changes the thermodynamic behavior of the         gas) and changes in ionization state (which alter how strongly         the gas couples to magnetic fields). As a result of these         complexities, there is nothing like a generally agreed-upon         theory of star formation, as there is for stellar structure.         Instead, we are forced to take a much more phenomenological         approach. These notes provide an introduction to our current         thinking about how star formation works.},

	abstract = {Observations of nearby galaxies have firmly established, over a broad         range of galactic environments and metallicities, that star         formation occurs exclusively in the molecular phase of the         interstellar medium (ISM). Theoretical models show that this         association results from the correlation between chemical phase,         shielding, and temperature. Interstellar gas converts from         atomic to molecular only in regions that are well shielded from         interstellar ultraviolet (UV) photons, and since UV photons are         also the dominant source of interstellar heating, only in these         shielded regions does the gas become cold enough to be subject         to Jeans instability. However, while the equilibrium temperature         and chemical state of interstellar gas are well correlated, the         timescale required to reach chemical equilibrium is much longer         than that required to reach thermal equilibrium, and both         timescales are metallicity-dependent. Here I show that the         difference in timescales implies that, at metallicities below a         few percent of the solar value, well shielded gas will reach low         temperatures and proceed to star formation before the bulk of it         is able to convert from atomic to molecular. As a result, at         extremely low metallicities, star formation will occur in a cold         atomic phase of the ISM rather than a molecular phase. I         calculate the observable consequences of this result for star         formation in low-metallicity galaxies, and I discuss how some         current numerical models for H$_{2}$-regulated star formation         may need to be modified.},

	abstract = {Star formation laws are rules that relate the rate of star formation in         a particular region, either an entire galaxy or some portion of         it, to the properties of the gas, or other galactic properties,         in that region. While observations of Local Group galaxies show         a very simple, local star formation law in which the star         formation rate per unit area in each patch of a galaxy scales         linearly with the molecular gas surface density in that patch,         recent observations of both Milky Way molecular clouds and high-         redshift galaxies apparently show a more complicated         relationship in which regions of equal molecular gas surface         density can form stars at quite different rates. These data have         been interpreted as implying either that different star         formation laws may apply in different circumstances, that the         star formation law is sensitive to large-scale galaxy properties         rather than local properties, or that there are high-density         thresholds for star formation. Here we collate observations of         the relationship between gas and star formation rate from         resolved observations of Milky Way molecular clouds, from kpc-         scale observations of Local Group galaxies, and from unresolved         observations of both disk and starburst galaxies in the local         universe and at high redshift. We show that all of these data         are in fact consistent with a simple, local, volumetric star         formation law. The apparent variations stem from the fact that         the observed objects have a wide variety of three-dimensional         size scales and degrees of internal clumping, so even at fixed         gas column density the regions being observed can have wildly         varying volume densities. We provide a simple theoretical         framework to remove this projection effect, and we use it to         show that all the data, from small solar neighborhood clouds         with masses \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde{}10$^{3}$ M $_{☉}$         to submillimeter galaxies with masses         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde{}10$^{11}$ M $_{☉}$, fall on a         single star formation law in which the star formation rate is         simply \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1\% of the molecular gas         mass per local free-fall time. In contrast, proposed star         formation laws in which the star formation timescale is set by         the galactic rotation period are inconsistent with the data from         the Milky Way and the Local Group, while those in which the star         formation rate is linearly proportional to the gas mass above         some density threshold fail both in the Local Group and for         starburst galaxies.},

@article{Krumholz2014,
	abstract = {Star formation lies at the center of a web of processes that drive         cosmic evolution: generation of radiant energy, synthesis of         elements, formation of planets, and development of life. Decades         of observations have yielded a variety of empirical rules about         how it operates, but at present we have no comprehensive,         quantitative theory. In this review I discuss the current state         of the field of star formation, focusing on three central         questions: What controls the rate at which gas in a galaxy         converts to stars? What determines how those stars are         clustered, and what fraction of the stellar population ends up         in gravitationally-bound structures? What determines the stellar         initial mass function, and does it vary with star-forming         environment? I use these three questions as a lens to introduce         the basics of star formation, beginning with a review of the         observational phenomenology and the basic physical processes. I         then review the status of current theories that attempt to solve         each of the three problems, pointing out links between them and         opportunities for theoretical and numerical work that crosses         the scale between them. I conclude with a discussion of         prospects for theoretical progress in the coming years.},

	abstract = {We investigate the formation of protoplanetary disks around nine solar-         mass stars formed in the context of a (40 pc)$^{3}$ Giant         Molecular Cloud model, using ramses adaptive mesh refinement         simulations extending over a scale range of about 4 million,         from an outer scale of 40 pc down to cell sizes of 2 au. Our         most important result is that the accretion process is         heterogeneous in multiple ways: in time, in space, and among         protostars of otherwise similar mass. Accretion is heterogeneous         in time, in the sense that accretion rates vary during the         evolution, with generally decreasing profiles, whose slopes vary         over a wide range, and where accretion can increase again if a         protostar enters a region with increased density and low speed.         Accretion is heterogeneous in space, because of the mass         distribution, with mass approaching the accreting star-disk         system in filaments and sheets. Finally, accretion is         heterogeneous among stars, since the detailed conditions and         dynamics in the neighborhood of each star can vary widely. We         also investigate the sensitivity of disk formation to physical         conditions and test their robustness by varying numerical         parameters. We find that disk formation is robust even when         choosing the least favorable sink particle parameters, and that         turbulence cascading from larger scales is a decisive factor in         disk formation. We also investigate the transport of angular         momentum, finding that the net inward mechanical transport is         compensated for mainly by an outward-directed magnetic         transport, with a contribution from gravitational torques         usually subordinate to the magnetic transport.},

The method employs the observed distribution function         of velocities and distances for a sample of tracer stars         extending to greater than about 1 kpc from the galactic plane,         along with the observed spatial density distribution         corresponding to that tracer population. In the second part,         this technique has been applied to new photometric and         spectroscopic data for a sample of K dwarfs toward the south         galactic pole. The results show a total surface mass density of         the galactic disk of 46 + or - 9 solar masses/sq pc. In the         third part, inconsistencies are pointed out in previous data         that suggest that about 50 percent of the local volume mass         density is not identified with known stars or with the         interstellar medium. Reanalysis of available F dwarf and K giant         data using the present models provides no evidence of missing         matter in addition to the identified 0.10 solar masses/cu pc.},

We have obtained new photometric and spectroscopic data for a         sample of K dwarfs towards the south galactic pole, and analysed         them using the distribution function modelling technique         described in the accompanying Paper I (Kuijken \&amp; Gilmore).         The surface mass density of identified mass can also be found,         by integrating the stellar population near the Sun through the         derived K$_{z}$ force law, and adding to that the observed         amount of interstellar gas. The total surface mass density of         the galactic disc derived from the dynamical analysis is         46{\ensuremath{\pm}}9 M$_{sun}$ pc$^{-2}$. The total identified         surface mass density of the galactic disc near the Sun is         48{\ensuremath{\pm}}8 M$_{sun}$ pc$^{-2}$. Thus, there is no         dynamically significant missing mass in the galactic disc near         the Sun, though there is certainly a massive dark halo. Some         implications of this result are discussed.},

It is shown that the accretion         disc around the neutron star intercepts and re-radiates 23 per         cent of burster luminosity during a flash (28 per cent if         general relativity is taken into account). The result is a         strong dependence of radiation flux from the burster during the         flash on the inclination angle of the system. The degree of         linear polarization of burster radiation during the flash         reaches the maximum value of 3.7 per cent in the direction of         {\ensuremath{\equiv}}72.4{\textdegree} from the normal. In         periods between flashes the stationary X-radiation is provided         mainly by the boundary layer. The disc re-radiates up to 50 per         cent of the boundary-layer radiation. This results in the abrupt         variation of the stationary X-ray flux direction. The degree to         which the radiation from the system is polarized depends only         weakly on the inclination angle of the system and is about 6 per         cent.},

	abstract = {Numerical calculations of the dynamics of a spherically symmetric         collapsing proto-star of one solar mass have been made for         various initial conditions. Calculations have also been made for         masses of 2M0 and M o. In all cases the collapse is found to be         extremely non-homologous and is such that a very small part of         the cloud's mass at the centre reaches stellar densities and         stops collapsing before most of the cloud has had time to         collapse very far. The stellar core thus formed subsequently         grows in mass as material falls into it, finally becoming an         ordinary star when all of the proto-stellar material has been         accreted. During most of this time the stellar core is         completely obscured by the dust in the infalling cloud, the         absorbed radiation reappearing in the infra-red as thermal         emission from the dust grains. The resulting star is almost a         conventional Hayashi pre-main sequence model, but it appears         rather low on the Hayashi track. For masses much greater than         about 2M0 the convective Hayashi phase does not exist at all. It         appears that certain properties of T Tauri stars may find         explanation in the results of the present calculations. In an         appendix to the paper it is shown that limiting forms may be         derived for the density and velocity distributions near the         centre of an isothermally collapsing sphere. This may be shown         to be possible also for a sphere with a polytropic equation of         state. Numerical results are presented for the limiting solution         in the isothermal case.},

	abstract = {Consideration is given to the turbulence properties of molecular clouds         and their implications for star formation. Data for 54 molecular         clouds and condensations is presented which reveals cloud         velocity dispersion and region size to follow a power-law         relation, similar to the Kolmogoroff law for subsonic         turbulence. Examination of the dynamics of the molecular clouds         for which mass determinations are available reveals essentially         all of them to be gravitationally bound, and to approximately         satisfy the virial theorem. The observation of moderate scatter         in the dispersion-size relation is noted to imply that most         regions have not collapsed much since formation, suggesting that         processes of turbulent hydrodynamics have played an important         role in producing the observed substructures. A lower limit to         the size of subcondensations at which their internal motions are         no longer supersonic is shown to predict a minimum protostellar         mass on the order of a few tenths of a solar mass, while massive         protostellar clumps are found to develop complex internal         structures, probably leading to the formation of prestellar         condensation nuclei. The observed turbulence of molecular clouds         is noted to imply lifetimes of less than 10 million years.},

	abstract = {Numerous cosmological simulations have been performed to study the         formation of the first objects. We present the results of high-         resolution 3D cosmological simulations of the formation of         primordial objects using the adaptive mesh refinement code FLASH         by including in an approximate manner the radiative transfer         effects of Lyman {\ensuremath{\alpha}} photons. We compare the         results of a Lyman {\ensuremath{\alpha}} trapping case inside         gas clouds with atomic and molecular hydrogen cooling cases. The         principal objective of this research is to follow the collapse         of a zero metallicity halo with an effective equation of state         (that accounts for the trapping) and to explore the fate of a         halo in each of the three cases, specifically the impact of         thermodynamics on the fragmentation of haloes. Our results show         that in the case of Lyman {\ensuremath{\alpha}} trapping,         fragmentation is halted and a massive object is formed at the         centre of a halo. The temperature of the gas remains well above         {}10$^{4}$ K and the halo is not able to fragment to stellar         masses. In the atomic cooling case, gas collapses into one or         two massive clumps in contrast to the Lyman         {\ensuremath{\alpha}} trapping case. For the molecular hydrogen         cooling case, gas cools efficiently and fragments. The formation         of massive primordial objects is thus strongly dependent on the         thermodynamics of the gas. A salient feature of our results is         that for the formation of massive objects, e.g. intermediate-         mass black holes, feedback effects are not required to suppress         H$_{2}$ cooling, as molecular hydrogen is collisionally         dissociated at temperatures higher than {}10$^{4}$ K as a         consequence of Lyman {\ensuremath{\alpha}} trapping.},

The         rapid formation process of these extreme objects remains a         fascinating and open issue. Such discovery implies that seed         black holes must have formed early on, and grown via either         rapid accretion or BH/galaxy mergers. In this theoretical         review, we discuss in detail various BH seed formation         mechanisms and the physical processes at play during their         assembly. We discuss the three most popular BH formation         scenarios, involving the (i) core-collapse of massive stars,         (ii) dynamical evolution of dense nuclear star clusters, (iii)         collapse of a protogalactic metal free gas cloud.

We cross-         correlate 5469 giant molecular clouds (GMCs) from a new all-sky         catalog with 256 star-forming complexes (SFCs) to build a sample         of 191 SFC-GMC complexes{\textemdash}collections of multiple         clouds each matched to 191 SFCs. The total mass in stars         harbored by these clouds is inferred from WMAP free-free fluxes.         We measure the GMC mass, the virial parameter, the star         formation efficiency {\ensuremath{\in}} and the star formation         rate per freefall time {\ensuremath{\in}} $_{ff}$. Both         {\ensuremath{\in}} and {\ensuremath{\in}} $_{ff}$ range over 3-4         orders of magnitude. We find that 68.3\% of the clouds fall         within \{{\ensuremath{\sigma}} \}$_{\{log}${\ensuremath{\in}}         \}=0.79+/- 0.22 \{dex\} and \{{\ensuremath{\sigma}}         \}$_{\{log}$\{{\ensuremath{\in}} \}$_{\{ff}$\}\}=0.91+/- 0.22         \{dex\} about the median.

Allowing for a time-variable         {\ensuremath{\in}} $_{ff}$, we can recover the large dispersion         in the rate of star formation. This strongly suggests that star         formation in the Milky Way is a dynamic process on GMC scales.         We also show that the surface star formation rate profile of the         Milky Way correlates well with the molecular gas surface density         profile.},

	abstract = {The formation of quasar black holes during the hydrodynamic collapse of         protogalactic gas clouds is discussed. The dissipational         collapse and long-term dynamical evolution of these systems is         analyzed using three- dimensional numerical simulations. The         calculations focus on the final collapse stages of the inner         baryonic component and therefore ignore the presence of dark         matter. Two types of initial conditions are considered:         uniformly rotating spherical clouds, and irrotational         ellipsoidal clouds. In both cases the clouds are initially cold,         homogeneous, and not far from rotational support (T/|W|         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.1). Although the details of         the dynamical evolution depend sensitively on the initial         conditions, the qualitative features of the final configurations         do not. Most of the gas is found to fragment into small dense         clumps, that eventually make up a spheroidal component         resembling a galactic bulge. About 5\% of the initial mass         remains in the form of a smooth disk of gas supported by         rotation in the gravitational potential well of the outer         spheroid. If a central seed black hole of mass         \&gt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 10\^6\^ M\_sun\_ forms, it         can grow by steady accretion from the disk and reach a typical         quasar black hole mass \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10\^8\^         M\_sun\_ in less than 5 X 10\^8\^ yr. In the absence of a         sufficiently massive seed, dynamical instabilities in a strongly         self-gravitating inner region of the disk will inhibit steady         accretion of gas and may prevent the immediate formation of a         quasar.},

	abstract = {Stellar feedback is often cited as the biggest uncertainty in galaxy         formation models today. This uncertainty stems from a dearth of         observational constraints as well as the great dynamic range         between the small scales (lsim1 pc) where the feedback         originates and the large scales of galaxies (gsim1 kpc) that are         shaped by this feedback. To bridge this divide, in this paper we         aim to assess observationally the role of stellar feedback at         the intermediate scales of H II regions         (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10-100 pc). In particular, we         employ multiwavelength data to examine several stellar feedback         mechanisms in a sample of 32 H II regions (with ages         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde3-10 Myr) in the Large and Small         Magellanic Clouds, respectively. Using optical, infrared, radio,         and X-ray images, we measure the pressures exerted on the shells         from the direct stellar radiation, the dust-processed radiation,         the warm ionized gas, and the hot X-ray-emitting gas. We find         that the warm ionized gas dominates over the other terms in all         of the sources, although two have comparable dust-processed         radiation pressures to their warm gas pressures. The hot gas         pressures are comparatively weak, while the direct radiation         pressures are one to two orders of magnitude below the other         terms. We discuss the implications of these results,         particularly highlighting evidence for hot gas leakage from the         H II shells and regarding the momentum deposition from the dust-         processed radiation to the warm gas. Furthermore, we emphasize         that similar observational work should be done on very young H         II regions to test whether direct radiation pressure and hot gas         can drive the dynamics at early times.},

The source was captured at {\ensuremath{\sim}}32\% L         $_{Edd}$, which is over four times more luminous than the         previous observation during the 2014 outburst. Both observations         exhibit a broadened Fe line profile. Through reflection         modeling, we determine that the inner disk is truncated         \{R\}$_{\{in}$,2016\}=\{11\}$_{-1}$$^{+2}$ \{R\}$_{g}$ (where R         $_{ g }$ = GM/c $^{2}$) and \{R\}$_{\{in}$,2014\}=14+/- 2         \{R\}$_{g}$ (errors quoted at the 90\% confidence level).         Fiducial NS parameters (M $_{NS}$ = 1.4 M $_{☉}$, R $_{NS}$ = 10         km) give a stellar radius of R $_{NS}$ = 4.85 R $_{ g }$; our         measurements rule out a disk extending to that radius at more         than the 6{\ensuremath{\sigma}} level of confidence. We are able         to place an upper limit on the magnetic field strength of B         {\ensuremath{\leq}} 3.0-4.5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{9}$ G at the         magnetic poles, assuming that the disk is truncated at the         magnetospheric radius in each case. This is consistent with         previous estimates of the magnetic field strength for Aquila         X-1. However, if the magnetosphere is not responsible for         truncating the disk prior to the NS surface, we estimate a         boundary layer with a maximum extent of         \{R\}$_{\{BL}$,2016\}{\ensuremath{\sim}} 10 \{R\}$_{g}$ and         \{R\}$_{\{BL}$,2014\}{\ensuremath{\sim}} 6 \{R\}$_{g}$.

	abstract = {We use high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations from the         Feedback in Realistic Environment (FIRE) project to study the         galaxy mass-metallicity relations (MZR) from z = 0-6. These         simulations include explicit models of the multiphase ISM, star         formation, and stellar feedback. The simulations cover halo         masses M$_{halo}$ = {}10$^{9}$-{}10$^{13}$ M$_{☉}$ and stellar         masses M$_{*}$ = {}10$^{4}$-{}10$^{11}$ M$_{☉}$ at z = 0 and         have been shown to produce many observed galaxy properties from         z = 0-6. For the first time, our simulations agree reasonably         well with the observed mass-metallicity relations at z = 0-3 for         a broad range of galaxy masses. We predict the evolution of the         MZR from z = 0-6, as log (Z\_gas/Z\_\{\{☉\}\}) = \{12 + log         (O/H) - 9.0\} = 0.35 [log (M\_\{*\}/M\_\{\{☉\}\})-10] + 0.93 exp         (-0.43z) - 1.05 and log (Z$_{*}$/Z$_{☉}$) = [Fe/H] + 0.2 =         0.40[log (M$_{*}$/M$_{☉}$) - 10] + 0.67exp ( - 0.50z) - 1.04,         for gas-phase and stellar metallicity, respectively. Our         simulations suggest that the evolution of MZR is associated with         the evolution of stellar/gas mass fractions at different         redshifts, indicating the existence of a universal metallicity         relation between stellar mass, gas mass, and metallicities. In         our simulations, galaxies above M$_{*}$ = {}10$^{6}$ M$_{☉}$ are         able to retain a large fraction of their metals inside the halo,         because metal-rich winds fail to escape completely and are         recycled into the galaxy. This resolves a longstanding         discrepancy between `subgrid' wind models (and semi-analytic         models) and observations, where common subgrid models cannot         simultaneously reproduce the MZR and the stellar mass functions.},

We         predict the stellar mass-halo mass relation, stellar mass         function, and luminosity function in several bands from z = 5 to         12. The median stellar mass-halo mass relation does not evolve         strongly at z = 5-12. The faint-end slope of the luminosity         function steepens with increasing redshift, as inherited from         the halo mass function at these redshifts. Below z         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6, the stellar mass function and ultraviolet         (UV) luminosity function slightly flatten below M$_{*}$         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10$^{4.5}$ M$_{☉}$ (fainter than M$_{1500}$         {\ensuremath{\sim}} -12), owing to the fact that star formation         in low-mass haloes is suppressed by the ionizing background by         the end of reionization. Such flattening does not appear at         higher redshifts. We provide redshift-dependent fitting         functions for the SFR-M$_{halo}$, SFR-M$_{*}$, and broad-band         magnitude-stellar mass relations. We derive the star formation         rate density and stellar mass density at z = 5-12 and show that         the contribution from very faint galaxies becomes more important         at z \&gt; 8. Furthermore, we find that the decline in the z         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6 UV luminosity function brighter than         M$_{1500}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} -20 is largely due to dust         attenuation. Approximately 37 per cent (54 per cent) of the UV         luminosity from galaxies brighter than M$_{1500}$ = -13 (-17) is         obscured by dust at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6.

These         simulations explicitly resolve the formation of proto-globular         clusters (GCs) self-consistently, where 17-39\% of stars form in         bound clusters during starbursts. Using post-processing Monte         Carlo radiative transfer calculations of ionizing radiation, we         compute f\_esc from cluster stars and non-cluster stars formed         during a starburst over \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde100 Myr         in each galaxy. We find that the averaged f\_esc over the         lifetime of a star particle follows a similar distribution for         cluster stars and non-cluster stars. Clusters tend to have low         f\_esc in the first few Myrs, presumably because they form         preferentially in more extreme environments with high optical         depths; the f\_esc increases later as feedback starts to disrupt         the natal cloud. On the other hand, non-cluster stars formed         between cluster complexes or in the compressed shell at the         front of a superbubble can also have high f\_esc. We find that         cluster stars on average have comparable f\_esc to non-cluster         stars. This result is robust across several star formation         models in our simulations. Our results suggest that the fraction         of ionizing photons from proto-GCs to cosmic reionization is         comparable to the cluster formation efficiency in high-redshift         galaxies and hence proto-GCs likely contribute an appreciable         fraction of photons but are not the dominant sources for         reionization.},

The simulations use an Eulerian adaptive mesh         refinement technique to follow the nonequilibrium chemistry of         nine chemical species with cosmological initial conditions drawn         from a popular {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}-dominated cold dark matter         model. The results confirm that the soft UV background can delay         the cooling and collapse of small halos         (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde{}10$^{6}$ M$_{solar}$). For         reasonable values of the photodissociating flux, the H$_{2}$         fraction is in equilibrium throughout most of the objects we         simulate. We determine the mass threshold for collapse for a         range of soft-UV fluxes and also derive a simple analytic         expression. Continuing the simulations beyond the point of         initial collapse demonstrates that the fraction of gas which can         cool depends mostly on the virial mass of the halo and the         amount of soft-UV flux, with remarkably little scatter. We         parameterize this relation, for use in semianalytic models.},

	abstract = {We investigate the 21 cm signature that may arise from the intergalactic         medium (IGM) prior to the epoch of full reionization (z \&gt;         5). In scenarios in which the IGM is reionized by discrete         sources of photoionizing radiation, the neutral gas that has not         yet been engulfed by an H II region may easily be preheated to         temperatures well above that of the cosmic background radiation         (CBR), rendering the IGM invisible in absorption against the         CBR. We identify three possible preheating mechanisms: (1)         photoelectric heating by soft X-rays from QSOs, (2)         photoelectric heating by soft X-rays from early galactic halos,         and (3) resonant scattering of the continuum UV radiation from         an early generation of stars. We find that bright quasars with         only a small fraction of the observed comoving density at z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 4 will suffice to preheat the         entire universe at z \&gt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 6. We         also show that, in a cold dark matter dominated cosmology, the         thermal bremsstrahlung radiation associated with collapsing         galactic mass halos ({}10$^{10}$-{}10$^{11}$ M$_{☉}$) may warm         the IGM to \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde100 K by z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 7. Alternatively, the         equivalent of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10\% of the star         formation rate density in the local universe, whether in         isolated pregalactic stars, dwarf, or normal galaxies, would be         capable of heating the entire IGM to a temperature above that of         the CBR by Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} scattering in a small         fraction of the Hubble time at z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 6. In the presence of a         sufficiently strong ambient flux of Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}}         photons, the hyperfine transition in the warmed H I will be         excited. A beam differencing experiment would detect a patchwork         of emission, both in frequency and in angle across the sky. This         patchwork could serve as a valuable tool for understanding the         epoch, nature, and sources of the reionization of the universe,         and their implications for cosmology. We demonstrate that         isolated QSOs will produce detectable signals at meter         wavelengths within their ``spheres of influence`` over which         they warm the IGM. As a result of the redshifted 21 cm radiation         emitted by warm H I bubbles, the spectrum of the radio         extragalactic background will display frequency structure with         velocity widths up to 10,000 km s$^{-1}$.

This scale is set either by the ``thermalization         distance'' from a QSO within which Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}}         pumping determines the spin temperature of the IGM or by the         quasar lifetime. Radio measurements near 235 and 150 MHz,         as will be possible in the near future using the Giant Metrewave         Radio Telescope, may provide the first detection of a neutral         IGM at 5 \&lt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde z         \&lt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 10. A next generation         facility like the Square Kilometer Array Interferometer could         effectively open much of the universe to a direct study of the         reheating epoch and possibly probe the transition from a neutral         universe to one that is fully ionized.},

It is composed of a low-mass power         law and a high-mass power law which are smoothly joined         together. Three parameters are needed to achieve this. The         standard IMFs of Kroupa (2001, 2002) and Chabrier (2003a)         (single stars or systems) are essentially indistinguishable from         this form. Compared to other three-parameter functions of the         IMF, the L$_{3}$ IMF has the advantage that the cumulative         distribution function and many other characteristic quantities         have a closed form, the mass generating function, for example,         can be written down explicitly.},

The sizes for graphite are estimated to vary from         about 0.005 to about 1 micron, and the observed uniformity of         extinction over the sky is explained in terms of a rather         uniform power-law exponent, which could have resulted from a         stochastic process in grain formation},

	abstract = {Using a quantitative model for bipolar outflows driven by hydromagnetic         protostellar winds, we calculate the efficiency of star         formation assuming that available gas is either converted into         stars or ejected in outflows. We estimate the efficiency of a         single star formation event in a protostellar core, finding         25\%-70\% for cores with various possible degrees of flattening.         The core mass function and the stellar initial mass function         have similar slopes because the efficiency is not sensitive to         its parameters. We then consider the disruption of gas from a         dense molecular clump in which a cluster of young stars is being         born. In both cases, we present analytical formulae for the         efficiencies that compare favorably against observations and,         for clusters, against numerical simulations. We predict         efficiencies in the range of 30\%-50\% for the regions that form         clusters of low-mass stars. In our model, star formation and gas         dispersal happen concurrently. We neglect the destructive         effects of massive stars: our results are therefore upper limits         to the efficiency in regions more massive than about 3000         M$_{solar }$.},

	abstract = {We present a new determination of the ultraviolet (UV) galaxy luminosity         function (LF) at redshift z ≃ 7 and 8, and a first estimate at z         ≃ 9. An accurate determination of the form and evolution of the         galaxy LF during this era is of key importance for improving our         knowledge of the earliest phases of galaxy evolution and the         process of cosmic reionization. Our analysis exploits to the         full the new, deepest Wide Field Camera 3/infrared imaging from         our Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Ultra-Deep Field 2012 (UDF12)         campaign, with dynamic range provided by including a new and         consistent analysis of all appropriate, shallower/wider area HST         survey data. Our new measurement of the evolving LF at z ≃ 7 to         8 is based on a final catalogue of ≃600 galaxies, and involves a         step-wise maximum-likelihood determination based on the         photometric redshift probability distribution for each object;         this approach makes full use of the 11-band imaging now         available in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF), including the         new UDF12 F140W data, and the latest Spitzer IRAC imaging. The         final result is a determination of the z ≃ 7 LF extending down         to UV absolute magnitudes M$_{1500}$ = -16.75 (AB mag) and the z         ≃ 8 LF down to M$_{1500}$ = -17.00. Fitting a Schechter         function, we find M$_{1500}$$^{*}$ = -19.90$^{+0.23}$$_{-0.28}$,         log {\ensuremath{\varphi}}* = -2.96$^{+0.18}$$_{-0.23}$ and a         faint-end slope {\ensuremath{\alpha}} =         -1.90$^{+0.14}$$_{-0.15}$ at z ≃ 7, and M$_{1500}$* =         -20.12$^{+0.37}$$_{-0.48}$, log {\ensuremath{\varphi}}* =         -3.35$^{+0.28}$$_{-0.47}$ and {\ensuremath{\alpha}} =         -2.02$^{+0.22}$$_{+0.23}$ at z ≃ 8. These results strengthen         previous suggestions that the evolution at z \&gt; 7 appears         more akin to `density evolution' than the apparent `luminosity         evolution' seen at z ≃ 5 - 7. We also provide the first         meaningful information on the LF at z ≃ 9, explore alternative         extrapolations to higher redshifts, and consider the         implications for the early evolution of UV luminosity density.         Finally, we provide catalogues (including derived z$_{phot}$,         M$_{1500}$ and photometry) for the most robust z         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6.5-11.9 galaxies used in this analysis. We         briefly discuss our results in the context of earlier work and         the results derived from an independent analysis of the UDF12         data based on colour-colour selection.},

	abstract = {The era of gravitational-wave astronomy began on 14 September 2015, when         the LIGO Scientific Collaboration detected the merger of two         {\ensuremath{\sim}}30 M\_☉ black holes at a distance of         \{{\ensuremath{\sim}} \}400 Mpc. This event has facilitated         qualitatively new tests of gravitational theories, and has also         produced exciting information about the astrophysical origin of         black hole binaries. In this review we discuss the implications         of this event for gravitational physics and astrophysics, as         well as the expectations for future detections. In brief: (1)         because the spins of the black holes could not be measured         accurately and because mergers are not well calculated for         modified theories of gravity, the current analysis of GW150914         does not place strong constraints on gravity variants that         change only the generation of gravitational waves, but (2) it         does strongly constrain alterations of the propagation of         gravitational waves and alternatives to black holes. Finally,         (3) many astrophysical models for the origin of heavy black hole         binaries such as the GW150914 system are in play, but a         reasonably robust conclusion that was reached even prior to the         detection is that the environment of such systems needs to have         a relatively low abundance of elements heavier than helium.},

	abstract = {The Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature         (EDGES) recently reported a strong 21-cm absorption signal         relative to the cosmic microwave background at z         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 18. While its anomalous amplitude may         indicate new physics, in this work we focus on the timing of the         signal, as it alone provides an important constraint on galaxy         formation models. Although rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity         functions (UVLFs) over a broad range of redshifts are well fit         by simple models in which galaxy star formation histories track         the assembly of dark matter haloes, we find that these same         models, with reasonable assumptions about X-ray production in         star-forming galaxies, cannot generate a narrow absorption         trough at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 18. If verified, the EDGES         signal therefore requires the fundamental inputs of galaxy         formation models to evolve rapidly at z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}         10. Unless extremely faint sources residing in haloes below the         atomic cooling threshold are responsible for the EDGES signal,         star formation in \{{\ensuremath{\sim}} \} 10\^8-10\^\{10\}         M\_\{☉ \} haloes must be more efficient than expected, implying         that the faint end of the UVLF at M$_{UV}$         {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} -12 must steepen at the highest         redshifts. This steepening provides a concrete test for future         galaxy surveys with the James Webb Space Telescope and ongoing         efforts in lensed fields, and is required regardless of whether         the amplitude of the EDGES signal is due to new cooling channels         or a strong radio background in the early Universe. However, the         radio background solution requires that galaxies at z \&gt; 15         emit 1-2 GHz photons with an efficiency {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}         {}10$^{2}$ times greater than local star-forming galaxies,         posing a challenge for models of low-frequency photon production         in the early Universe.},

	abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF), along with the star formation         rate, is one of the fundamental properties that any theory of         star formation must explain. An interesting feature of the IMF         is that it appears to be remarkably universal across a wide         range of environments. Particularly, there appears to be little         variation in either the characteristic mass of the IMF or its         high-mass tail between clusters with different metallicities.         Previous attempts to understand this apparent independence of         metallicity have not accounted for radiation feedback from high-         mass protostars, which can dominate the energy balance of the         gas in star-forming regions. We extend this work, showing that         the fragmentation of molecular gas should depend only weakly on         the amount of dust present, even when the primary heating source         is radiation from massive protostars. First, we report a series         of core collapse simulations using the ORION AMR code that         systematically vary the dust opacity and show explicitly that         this has little effect on the temperature or fragmentation of         the gas. Then, we provide an analytic argument for why the IMF         varies so little in observed star clusters, even as the         metallicity varies by a factor of 100.},

We use new Keck/LRIS spectra of Lyman break galaxies         (LBGs) and narrowband-selected Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emitters         (LAEs) to measure redshifts for 16 LBGs and 87 LAEs at z \&gt;         3.055, such that our NB3640 imaging probes the Lyman-continuum         (LyC) region. When we include the existing set of         spectroscopically confirmed LBGs, our total sample with z \&gt;         3.055 consists of 41 LBGs and 91 LAEs, of which 9 LBGs and 20         LAEs are detected in our NB3640 image. With our combined imaging         and spectroscopic data sets, we critically investigate the         origin of NB3640 emission for detected LBGs and LAEs. We remove         from our samples three LBGs and three LAEs with spectroscopic         evidence of contamination of their NB3640 flux by foreground         galaxies and statistically model the effects of additional,         unidentified foreground contaminants. The resulting         contamination and LyC-detection rates, respectively, are 62\%         {\ensuremath{\pm}} 13\% and 8\% {\ensuremath{\pm}} 3\% for our         LBG sample, and 47\% {\ensuremath{\pm}} 10\% and 12\%         {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2\% for our LAE sample. The corresponding         ratios of non-ionizing UV to LyC flux density, corrected for         intergalactic medium (IGM) attenuation, are 18.0$^{+34.8}$         $_{-7.4}$ for LBGs and 3.7$^{+2.5}$ $_{-1.1}$ for LAEs. We use         these ratios to estimate the total contribution of star-forming         galaxies to the ionizing background and the hydrogen         photoionization rate in the IGM, finding values larger than, but         consistent with, those measured in the Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}}         forest. Finally, the measured UV to LyC flux-density ratios         imply model-dependent LyC escape fractions of f $^{LyC}$         $_{esc}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 5\%-7\% for our LBG         sample and f $^{LyC}$ $_{esc}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde         10\%-30\% for our fainter LAE sample.

	abstract = {For dark matter (DM) particles with masses in the 0.6-6m $_{p}$ range,         we set stringent constraints on the interaction cross-sections         for scattering with ordinary baryonic matter. These constraints         follow from the recognition that such particles can be captured         by{\textemdash}and thermalized within{\textemdash}the Earth,         leading to a substantial accumulation and concentration of DM         that interact with baryons. Here, we discuss the probability         that DM intercepted by the Earth will be captured, the number of         DM particles thereby accumulated over Earth{\textquoteright}s         lifetime, the fraction of such particles retained in the face of         evaporation, and the density distribution of such particles         within the Earth. In the latter context, we note that a previous         treatment of the density distribution of DM, presented by Gould         and Raffelt and applied subsequently to DM in the Sun, is         inconsistent with considerations of hydrostatic equilibrium. Our         analysis provides an estimate of the DM particle density at         Earth{\textquoteright}s surface, which may exceed {}10$^{14}$         cm$^{-3}$, and leads to constraints on various scattering cross-         sections, which are placed by (1) the lifetime of the         relativistic proton beam at the Large Hadron Collider; (2) the         orbital decay of spacecraft in low Earth orbit; (3) the         vaporization rate of cryogenic liquids in well-insulated storage         dewars; and (4) the thermal conductivity of         Earth{\textquoteright}s crust. For the scattering cross-sections         that were invoked recently in Barkana{\textquoteright}s original         explanation for the anomalously deep 21 cm absorption reported         by EDGES, DM particle masses in the 0.6-4m $_{p}$ range are         excluded.},

	abstract = {We review the current knowledge about nuclear star clusters (NSCs), the         spectacularly dense and massive assemblies of stars found at the         centers of most galaxies. Recent observational and theoretical         work suggest that many NSC properties, including their masses,         densities, and stellar populations vary with the properties of         their host galaxies. Understanding the formation, growth, and         ultimate fate of NSCs therefore is crucial for a complete         picture of galaxy evolution. Throughout the review, we attempt         to combine and distill the available evidence into a coherent         picture of NSC evolution. Combined, this evidence points to a         clear transition mass in galaxies of         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10\^9 solar masses where the         characteristics of nuclear star clusters change. We argue that         at lower masses, NSCs are formed primarily from globular         clusters that inspiral into the center of the galaxy, while at         higher masses, star formation within the nucleus forms the bulk         of the NSC. We also discuss the coexistence of NSCs and central         black holes, and how their growth may be linked. The extreme         densities of NSCs and their interaction with massive black holes         lead to a wide range of unique phenomena including tidal         disruption and gravitational wave events. Lastly, we review the         evidence that many NSCs end up in the halos of massive galaxies         stripped of the stars that surrounded them, thus providing         valuable tracers of the galaxies' accretion histories.},

To         place the issue in an observational context, we summarize the         techniques used to determine the IMF for different stellar         populations, the uncertainties affecting the results, and the         evidence for systematic departures from universality under         extreme circumstances. We next consider theories for the         formation of prestellar cores by turbulent fragmentation and the         possible impact of various thermal, hydrodynamic, and magneto-         hydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities. We address the conversion of         prestellar cores into stars and evaluate the roles played by         different processes: competitive accretion, dynamical         fragmentation, ejection and starvation, filament fragmentation         and filamentary accretion flows, disk formation and         fragmentation, critical scales imposed by thermodynamics, and         magnetic braking. We present explanations for the characteristic         shapes of the present-day prestellar core mass function (CMF)         and the IMF and consider what significance can be attached to         their apparent similarity. Substantial computational advances         have occurred in recent years, and we review the numerical         simulations that have been performed to predict the IMF directly         and discuss the influence of dynamics, time-dependent phenomena,         and initial conditions.},

A model is developed         for the origin of the stellar IMF that contains a dependence on         the average physical parameters (temperature, density and         velocity dispersion) of the large-scale site of star formation.         The model is based on recent numerical experiments of highly         supersonic random flows that have a strong observational         counterpart. It is shown that a Miller-Scalo-like IMF is         naturally produced by the model for the typical physical         conditions in molecular clouds.

	abstract = {The morphology and kinematics of molecular clouds (MCs) are best         explained as the consequence of supersonic turbulence.         Supersonic turbulence fragments MCs into dense sheets,         filaments, and cores and large low-density ``voids,'' via the         action of highly radiative shocks. We refer to this process as         turbulent fragmentation. In this work we derive the mass         distribution of gravitationally unstable cores generated by the         process of turbulent fragmentation. The mass distribution above         1 M$_{solar}$ depends primarily on the power spectrum of the         turbulent flow and on the jump conditions for isothermal shocks         in a magnetized gas. For a power spectrum index         {\ensuremath{\beta}}=1.74, consistent with Larson's velocity         dispersion-size relation as well as with new numerical and         analytic results on supersonic turbulence, we obtain a power-law         mass distribution of dense cores with a slope equal to         3/(4-{\ensuremath{\beta}})=1.33, consistent with the slope of         the stellar initial mass function (IMF). Below 1 M$_{solar}$,         the mass distribution flattens and turns around at a fraction of         1 M$_{solar}$, as observed for the stellar IMF in a number of         stellar clusters, because only the densest cores are         gravitationally unstable. The mass distribution at low masses is         determined by the probability distribution of the gas density,         which is known to be approximately lognormal for an isothermal         turbulent gas. The intermittent nature of the turbulent density         distribution is thus responsible for the existence of a         significant number of small collapsing cores, even of substellar         mass. Since turbulent fragmentation is unavoidable in         supersonically turbulent molecular clouds, and given the success         of the present model in predicting the observed shape of the         stellar IMF, we conclude that turbulent fragmentation is         essential to the origin of the stellar IMF.},

Molecular clouds are shaped into a complex         filamentary structure by supersonic turbulence, with only a         small fraction of the cloud mass channeled into collapsing         protostars over a free-fall time of the system. In recent years,         the physics of supersonic turbulence has been widely explored         with computer simulations, leading to statistical models of this         fragmentation process, and to the prediction of the star         formation rate as a function of fundamental physical parameters         of molecular clouds, such as the virial parameter, the root mean         square (rms) Mach number, the compressive fraction of the         turbulence driver, and the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure.

	abstract = {The observation of GW170817 in both gravitational and electromagnetic         waves provides a number of unique tests of general relativity.         One question we can answer with this event is: do large-         wavelength gravitational waves and short-frequency photons         experience the same number of spacetime dimensions? In models         that include additional non-compact spacetime dimensions, as the         gravitational waves propagate, they ``leak'' into the extra         dimensions, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of the         observed gravitational waves, and a commensurate systematic         error in the inferred distance to the gravitational wave source.         Electromagnetic waves would remain unaffected. We compare the         inferred distance to GW170817 from the observation of         gravitational waves, d$_{L}$$^{GW}$, with the inferred distance         to the electromagnetic counterpart NGC 4993, d$_{L}$$^{EM}$. We         constrain d$_{L}$$^{GW}$ =         (d$_{L}$$^{EM}$/Mpc)$^{{\ensuremath{\gamma}}}$ with         {\ensuremath{\gamma}} = 1.01$^{+0.04}$$_{-0.05}$ (for the SHoES         value of H$_{0}$) or {\ensuremath{\gamma}} =         0.99$^{+0.03}$$_{-0.05}$ (for the Planck value of H$_{0}$),         where all values are MAP and minimal 68\% credible intervals.         These constraints imply that gravitational waves propagate in         D=3+1 spacetime dimensions, as expected in general relativity.         In particular, we find that D = 4.02$^{+0.07}$$_{-0.10}$ (SHoES)         and D = 3.98$^{+0.07}$$_{-0.09}$ (Planck). Furthermore, we place         limits on the screening scale for theories with D\&gt;4         spacetime dimensions, finding that the screening scale must be         greater than \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 20 Mpc. We also         place a lower limit on the lifetime of the graviton of t \&gt;         4.50 {\texttimes} {}10$^{8}$ yr.},

	abstract = {Interstellar dust in the Magellanic Clouds, with a weak or nearly absent         2175 A extinction feature, may be of interest in studies of         galaxies in early stages of chemical evolution. To this inquiry,         we extend the graphite-silicate grain model, introduced by         Mathis, Rumpl, \&amp; Nordsieck and developed by Draine \&amp;         Lee, from the Milky Way to the Magellanic Clouds. We find that         the empirical extinction curves in the Large and Small         Magellanic Clouds can be reproduced by adjusting only the         relative abundances of graphite and silicate grains, while         leaving all other model properties fixed to those appropriate         for the Galactic extinction curve. Using the graphite-silicate         models, we calculate the absorption and scattering optical         depths, the mass-density ratio of interstellar dust to neutral         hydrogen, and the Kramers-Kronig relation for all three         galaxies. We also present a fitting function for the three         extinction curves, valid not only over the observed range of         wavelengths but also over the full range as predicted by the         models. All the quantities we derived here are independent of         the dust-to-gas ratios in the Milky Way and the Magellanic         Clouds, and can be applied to other galaxies if they contain         Galactic or Magellanic-type dust.},

	abstract = {We study the dynamical evolution of supermassive black holes, in the         late stage of galaxy mergers, from kpc to pc scales. In         particular, we capture the formation of the binary, a necessary         step before the final coalescence, and trace back the main         processes causing the decay of the orbit. We use hydrodynamical         simulations of galaxy mergers with different resolutions, from         20 pc down to 1 pc, in order to study the effects of the         resolution on our results, remove numerical effects, and assess         that resolving the influence radius of the orbiting black hole         is a minimum condition to fully capture the formation of the         binary. Our simulations include the relevant physical processes,         namely star formation, supernova feedback, accretion on to the         black holes and the ensuing feedback. We find that, in these         mergers, dynamical friction from the smooth stellar component of         the nucleus is the main process that drives black holes from kpc         to pc scales. Gas does not play a crucial role and even clumps         do not induce scattering or perturb the orbits. We compare the         time needed for the formation of the binary to analytical         predictions and suggest how to apply such analytical formalism         to obtain estimates of binary formation times in lower         resolution simulations.},

We find that star clusters         with initial half-mass relaxation times         \&lt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde25 Myr are dominated by         stellar collisions, the first collisions occurring at or near         the point of core collapse, which is driven by the segregation         of the most massive stars to the cluster center, where they end         up in hard binaries. The majority of collisions occur with the         same star, resulting in the runaway growth of a supermassive         object.

The properties of this         source are best explained by invoking a black hole with a mass         of at least 350 solar masses (350M$_{solar}$), which is         intermediate between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.         A nearby but somewhat more massive cluster (MGG 9) shows no         evidence of such an intermediate-mass black hole, raising the         issue of just what physical characteristics of the clusters can         account for this difference. Here we report numerical         simulations of the evolution and motion of stars within the         clusters, where stars are allowed to merge with each other. We         find that for MGG 11 dynamical friction leads to the massive         stars sinking rapidly to the centre of the cluster, where they         participate in a runaway collision. This produces a star of         800-3,000 M$_{solar}$, which ultimately collapses to a black         hole of intermediate mass. No such runaway occurs in the cluster         MGG 9, because the larger cluster radius leads to a mass         segregation timescale a factor of five longer than for MGG 11.},

	abstract = {Several observational and theoretical arguments suggest that starburst         galaxies may rival quasars as sources of metagalactic ionizing         radiation at redshifts z\&gt;3. Reionization of the         intergalactic medium (IGM) at z\&gt;5 may arise, in part, from         the first luminous massive stars. To be an important source of         radiative feedback from star formation, a substantial fraction         (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1\%-10\%) of the ionizing         photons must escape the gas layers of the galaxies. Using models         of smoothly distributed gas confined by dark matter (DM)         potentials, we estimate the fraction, \&lt;f$_{esc}$\&gt; , of         Lyman-continuum flux that escapes the halos of spherical         galaxies as a function of their mass and virialization redshift.         The gas density profile is found by solving the equation of         hydrostatic equilibrium for the baryonic matter in the potential         well of a DM halo with the density profile found by Navarro et         al. We then perform a parametric study to understand the         dependence of \&lt;f$_{esc}$\&gt; on redshift, mass, baryonic         fraction, star formation efficiency (SFE), stellar density         distribution, and OB association luminosity function. We give         useful analytical formulas for \&lt;f$_{esc}$(z,M$_{DM}$)\&gt;.         Using the Press-Schechter formalism, we find that stellar         reionization at z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde7 is probably         dominated by small galactic subunits, with         M$_{DM}$\&lt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde{}10$^{7}$         M$_{solar}$ and SFE\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10 times that         in the Milky Way.

Theoretical         work and observations seem to indicate that the fraction,         \&lt;f$_{esc}$\&gt;, of HI ionizing radiation emitted from         galaxies that escapes into the IGM is small in the local         Universe         (\&lt;f$_{esc}$\&gt;\&lt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 10 per         cent). At high redshift, galaxies are more compact and probably         gas-rich, implying smaller values of \&lt;f$_{esc}$\&gt; from         their discs or spheroids. However, if the sites of star         formation are displaced from the disc or spheroid and the star         formation efficiency of the proto-clusters is high, then         \&lt;f$_{esc}$\&gt; should be about 1. This star formation         scenario is consistent with several models for globular cluster         formation. Using simple arguments based on the observed number         of globular cluster systems in the local Universe, and assuming         that the oldest globular clusters formed before reionization and         had \&lt;f$_{esc}$\&gt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1, I         show that they produced enough ionizing photons to reionize the         IGM at z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 6.},

	abstract = {We investigate the effect of nonevaporating primordial black holes         (PBHs) on the ionization and thermal history of the universe.         X-rays emitted by gas accretion onto PBHs modify the cosmic         recombination history, producing measurable effects on the         spectrum and anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background         (CMB). Using the third-year WMAP data and COBE FIRAS data we         improve existing upper limits on the abundance of PBHs with         masses \&gt;0.1 M$_{☉}$ by several orders of magnitude. The new         upper limits still allow PBHs to be important for the origin of         supermassive black holes and ultraluminous X-ray sources.         Fitting WMAP3 data with cosmological models that do not allow         for nonstandard recombination histories, as produced by PBHs or         other early energy sources, may lead to an underestimate of the         best-fit values of the amplitude of linear density fluctuations         ({\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$) and the scalar spectral index         (n$_{s}$). Cosmological parameter estimates are affected because         models with PBHs allow for larger values of the Thomson         scattering optical depth, whose correlation with other         parameters may not be correctly taken into account when PBHs are         ignored. Values of {\ensuremath{\tau}}$_{e}$         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.2, n$_{s}$         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1, and         {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$ \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.9         are allowed at 95\% CF. This result may relieve recent tension         between WMAP3 data and clusters data on the value of         {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$. PBHs may increase the primordial         molecular hydrogen abundance by up to 2 orders of magnitude,         this promoting cooling and star formation. The suppression of         galaxy formation due to X-ray heating is negligible for models         consistent with the CMB data. Thus, the formation rate of the         first galaxies and stars would be enhanced by a population of         PBHs.},

	abstract = {Population III stars are typically massive stars of primordial         composition forming at the centres of the first collapsed dark         matter structures. Here we estimate the optimal X-ray emission         in the early universe for promoting the formation of Population         III stars. This is important in determining the number of dwarf         galaxies formed before reionization and their fossils in the         local universe, as well as the number of intermediate-mass seed         black holes. A mean X-ray emission per source above the optimal         level reduces the number of Population III stars because of the         increased Jeans mass of the intergalactic medium, while a lower         emission suppresses the formation rate of H$_{2}$ preventing or         delaying star formation in dark matter minihaloes above the         Jeans mass. The build-up of the H$_{2}$ dissociating background         is slower than the X-ray background due to the shielding effect         of resonant hydrogen Lyman lines. Hence, the nearly unavoidable         X-ray emission from supernova remnants of Population III stars         is sufficient to boost their number to few tens per comoving         Mpc$^{3}$ by redshift z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 15. We find that         there is a critical X-ray to ultraviolet energy ratio emitted         per source that produces a universe where the number of         Population III stars is largest: 400 per comoving Mpc$^{3}$.         This critical ratio is very close to the one provided by 20-40         M$_{☉}$ Population III stars exploding as hypernovae. High-mass         X-ray binaries in dwarf galaxies are far less effective at         increasing the number of Population III stars than normal         supernova remnants, we thus conclude that supernovae drove the         formation of Population III stars.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the first in a series on galaxy formation before         reionization, we focus on understanding what determines the size         and morphology of stellar objects in the first low-mass         galaxies, using parsec-scale cosmological simulations performed         with an adaptive mesh hydrodynamics code. Although the dense gas         in which stars are formed tends to have a disk structure, stars         are found in spheroids with little rotation. Halos with masses         between \{10\}$^{6}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$ and 5{\texttimes} \{10\}$^{8}$         \{M\}$_{☉ }$ form stars stochastically, with stellar masses in         the range \{10\}$^{4}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$ to 2{\texttimes}         \{10\}$^{6}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$. We observe, nearly independent of         stellar mass, a large range of half-light radii for the stars,         from a few parsecs to a few hundred parsecs and surface         brightnesses and mass-to-light ratios ranging from those typical         of globular clusters to ultra-faint dwarfs. In our simulations,         stars form in dense stellar clusters with high gas-to-star         conversion efficiencies and rather uniform metallicities. A         fraction of these clusters remain bound after the gas is removed         by feedback, but others are destroyed, and their stars, which         typically have velocity dispersions of 20-40 km s$^{-1}$, expand         until they become bound by the dark matter halo. We thus         speculate that the stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies may show         kinematic and chemical signatures consistent with their origin         in a few distinct stellar clusters. On the other hand, some         globular clusters may form at the center of primordial dwarf         galaxies and may contain dark matter, perhaps detectable in the         outer parts.},

	abstract = {Turbulence influences the behavior of many astrophysical systems,         frequently by providing non-thermal pressure support through         random bulk motions. Although turbulence is commonly studied in         systems with constant volume and mean density, turbulent         astrophysical gases often expand or contract under the influence         of pressure or gravity. Here, we examine the behavior of         turbulence in contracting volumes using idealized models of         compressed gases. Employing numerical simulations and an         analytical model, we identify a simple mechanism by which the         turbulent motions of contracting gases ``adiabatically heat,''         experiencing an increase in their random bulk velocities until         the largest eddies in the gas circulate over a Hubble time of         the contraction. Adiabatic heating provides a mechanism for         sustaining turbulence in gases where no large-scale driving         exists. We describe this mechanism in detail and discuss some         potential applications to turbulence in astrophysical settings.},

	abstract = {We present a new implementation of radiation hydrodynamics (RHD) in the         adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code RAMSES. The multigroup         radiative transfer (RT) is performed on the AMR grid with a         first-order Godunov method using the M1 closure for the         Eddington tensor, and is coupled to the hydrodynamics via non-         equilibrium thermochemistry of hydrogen and helium. This moment-         based approach has the great advantage that the computational         cost is independent of the number of radiative sources - it can         even deal with continuous regions of emission such as bound-free         emission from gas. As it is built directly into RAMSES, the RT         takes natural advantage of the refinement and parallelization         strategies already in place. Since we use an explicit advection         solver for the radiative transport, the time-step is restricted         by the speed of light - a severe limitation that can be         alleviated using the so-called reduced speed of light         approximation. We propose a rigorous framework to assess the         validity of this approximation in various conditions encountered         in cosmology and galaxy formation. We finally perform with our         newly developed code a complete suite of RHD tests, comparing         our results to other RHD codes. The tests demonstrate that our         code performs very well and is ideally suited for exploring the         effect of radiation on current scenarios of structure and galaxy         formation.},

	abstract = {We present the SPHINX suite of cosmological adaptive mesh refinement         simulations, the first radiation-hydrodynamical simulations to         simultaneously capture large-scale reionization and the escape         of ionizing radiation from thousands of resolved galaxies. Our 5         and 10 co-moving Mpc volumes resolve haloes down to the atomic         cooling limit and model the interstellar medium with better than         {\ensuremath{\approx}}10 pc resolution. The project has numerous         goals in improving our understanding of reionization and making         predictions for future observations. In this first paper, we         study how the inclusion of binary stars in computing stellar         luminosities impacts reionization, compared to a model that         includes only single stars. Owing to the suppression of galaxy         growth via strong feedback, our galaxies are in good agreement         with observational estimates of the galaxy luminosity function.         We find that binaries have a significant impact on the timing of         reionization: with binaries, our boxes are 99.9 percent ionized         by volume at z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 7, while without them our         volumes fail to reionize by z = 6. These results are robust to         changes in volume size, resolution, and feedback efficiency. The         escape of ionizing radiation from individual galaxies varies         strongly and frequently. On average, binaries lead to escape         fractions of {\ensuremath{\approx}}7-10 percent, about three         times higher than with single stars only. The higher escape         fraction is a result of a shallower decline in ionizing         luminosity with age, and is the primary reason for earlier         reionization, although the higher integrated luminosity with         binaries also plays a subdominant role.},

	abstract = {We reanalyze the catalogs of molecular clouds in the Local Group to         determine the parameters of their mass distributions in a         uniform manner. The analysis uses the error-in-variables method         of parameter estimation, which accounts not only for the         variance of the sample when drawn from a parent distribution,         but also for errors in the mass measurements. Testing the method         shows that it recovers the underlying properties of cumulative         mass distribution without bias while accurately reflecting         uncertainties in the parameters. Clouds in the inner disk of the         Milky Way follow a truncated power-law distribution with index         {\ensuremath{\gamma}}=-1.5+/-0.1 and maximum mass of 10$^{6.5}$         M$_{solar}$. The distributions of cloud mass for the outer Milky         Way and M33 show significantly steeper indices         ({\ensuremath{\gamma}}$_{OMW}$=-2.1+/-0.2 and         {\ensuremath{\gamma}}$_{M33}$=-2.9+/-0.4, respectively), with no         evidence of a cutoff. The mass distribution of clouds in the         Large Magellanic Cloud has a marginally steeper distribution         than the inner disk of the Milky Way         ({\ensuremath{\gamma}}=-1.7+/-0.2) and also shows evidence of a         truncation, with a maximum mass of 10$^{6.5}$ M$_{solar}$. The         mass distributions of molecular clouds vary dramatically across         the Local Group, even after accounting for the systematic errors         that arise in comparing heterogeneous data and catalogs. These         differences should be accounted for in studies that aim to         reproduce the molecular cloud mass distributions, or in studies         that use the mass spectrum as a parameter in a model.},

	abstract = {We examine various implications from a dynamical and chemical model of         globular clusters (GCs), which successfully reproduces the         observed abundance patterns and the multiple populations of         stars in these systems assuming chemical enrichment from fast-         rotating massive stars. Using the model of Decressin et al., we         determine the ratio between the observed, present-day mass of         GCs and their initial stellar mass as a function of the stellar         initial mass function (IMF). We also compute the mass of low-         mass stars ejected and the amount of hydrogen ionizing photons         emitted by the proto-GCs. Typically, we find that the initial         masses of GCs must be {\ensuremath{\sim}}8-10 times (or up to 25         times, if second-generation stars also escape from GCs) larger         than the present-day stellar mass. The present-day Galactic GC         population must then have contributed to approximately 5-8 per         cent (10-20 per cent) of the low-mass stars in the Galactic         halo. We also show that the detection of second-generation stars         in the Galactic halo, recently announced by different groups,         provides a new constraint on the GC IMF (GCIMF). These         observations appear to rule out a power-law GCIMF, whereas they         are compatible with a lognormal one. Finally, the high initial         masses also imply that GCs must have emitted a large amount of         ionizing photons in the early Universe. Our results reopen the         question on the IMF of GCs and reinforce earlier conclusions         that old GCs could have represented a significant contribution         to reionize the intergalactic medium at high redshift.},

	abstract = {We present GAMER-2, a GPU-accelerated adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)         code for astrophysics. It provides a rich set of features,         including adaptive time-stepping, several hydrodynamic schemes,         magnetohydrodynamics, self-gravity, particles, star formation,         chemistry, and radiative processes with GRACKLE, data analysis         with YT, and memory pool for efficient object allocation.         GAMER-2 is fully bitwise reproducible. For the performance         optimization, it adopts hybrid OpenMP/MPI/GPU parallelization         and utilizes overlapping CPU computation, GPU computation, and         CPU-GPU communication. Load balancing is achieved using a         Hilbert space-filling curve on a level-by-level basis without         the need to duplicate the entire AMR hierarchy on each MPI         process. To provide convincing demonstrations of the accuracy         and performance of GAMER-2, we directly compare with ENZO on         isolated disc galaxy simulations and with FLASH on galaxy         cluster merger simulations. We show that the physical results         obtained by different codes are in very good agreement, and         GAMER-2 outperforms ENZO and FLASH by nearly one and two orders         of magnitude, respectively, on the Blue Waters supercomputers         using 1-256 nodes. More importantly, GAMER-2 exhibits similar or         even better parallel scalability compared to the other two         codes. We also demonstrate good weak and strong scaling using up         to 4096 GPUs and 65 536 CPU cores, and achieve a uniform         resolution as high as 10 240\^3 cells. Furthermore, GAMER-2 can         be adopted as an AMR + GPUs framework and has been extensively         used for the wave dark matter simulations. GAMER-2 is open         source (available at https://github.com/gamer-project/gamer) and         new contributions are welcome.},

	abstract = {It is assumed that the rate of star formation for population I varies         with a power n of the density of interstellar gas and that the         initial luminosity function is time-independent. Direct evidence         on the value of n is found in the relative distribution,         perpendicular to the galactic plane, of gas and young objects.         For various values of n, computations were made of the initial         luminosity function, the rate of star formation, the exchange of         gas between stars and interstellar medium, the number of white         dwarfs and their luminosity function, and the abundance of         helium. It is concluded, from a comparison of the results with         observational data, that n is around 2. The present rate of star         formation, then, is five times slower than the average rate. The         interstellar gas, of which the surface density on the galactic         plane was taken to be 11 per square parsec, loses 1.4 O/pc2 per         10 years by the formation of stars but gains about one-third of         this by ejection of gas from evolving stars. The present helium         abundance of the interstellar gas may be explained if a star has         burned, on the average, 53 per cent of its original hydrogen         into helium at the time that ejection takes place. The ejected         material was assumed to have a composition equal to the average         composition of the star. The effect of star formation on the gas         density in the galactic system and other galaxies is briefly         discussed.},

	abstract = {Compact 1111 regions of high electron density but small linear         dimensions are believed to be the ionized remnants of recently         formed 0 stars or clusters of 0 stars. In this survey, H ii         regions of high surface brightness in the radio continuum are         mapped at the wavelength of 1.95 cm with an angular resolution         of about 2'. Compact 1111 regions are found to be superimposed         on an extended background of lower surface brightness. After         separation from the background, the physical parameters of the         compact components are determined. Their electron temperatures,         rms velocities of internal turbulence, and kinematic dis- tances         are obtained from observations of the H109a line. Where         possible, radio contours are compared with the optical picture         of the H ii region as determined by its Ha radiation. Although         there is a general agreement between radio and optical features,         marked differences are found in a detailed comparison. It seems         that for most of the investigated H ii regions the variation in         optical surface brightness is to a large extent determined by         obscuration by dust rather than by the emission measure. With a         few exceptions, the exciting stars of compact H ii regions could         not be found, a fact that implies these stars are hidden behind         a dense cocoon of dust, which seems to be capable of prevailing         in the ultraviolet radiation field of an 0 star for a relatively         long period. The radio center of a compact component in M8         coincides with the ``hourglass'' nebula, which might be part of         the ionized cocoon of the 07 star Herschel 36. Centers of non-         thermal emission of the two central OH lines are found to be         closely associated with nearby compact H ii regions. Velocity         dispersions range between 1.2 and 16 km sec'; the projected         distances range from 0.08 to 1.4 pc. Recent observations are         consistent with the hypothesis that centers of non-thermal OH         emission are protostars, i.e., dense condensations of neutral         matter which are im- bedded in H it regions of low electron         density},

	abstract = {We present 3D 'zoom-in' simulations of the formation of two molecular         clouds out of the galactic interstellar medium. We model the         clouds - identified from the SILCC simulations - with a         resolution of up to 0.06 pc using adaptive mesh refinement in         combination with a chemical network to follow heating, cooling         and the formation of H$_{2}$ and CO including (self-) shielding.         The two clouds are assembled within a few million years with         mass growth rates of up to {\ensuremath{\sim}}10$^{-2}$ M$_{☉}$         yr$^{-1}$ and final masses of {\ensuremath{\sim}}50 000 M$_{☉}$.         A spatial resolution of {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}0.1 pc is         required for convergence with respect to the mass, velocity         dispersion and chemical abundances of the clouds, although these         properties also depend on the cloud definition such as based on         density thresholds, H$_{2}$ or CO mass fraction. To avoid grid         artefacts, the progressive increase of resolution has to occur         within the free-fall time of the densest structures (1-1.5 Myr)         and {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}200 time-steps should be spent on each         refinement level before the resolution is progressively         increased further. This avoids the formation of spurious, large-         scale, rotating clumps from unresolved turbulent flows. While CO         is a good tracer for the evolution of dense gas with number         densities n {\ensuremath{\geq}} 300 cm$^{-3}$, H$_{2}$ is also         found for n {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 30 cm$^{-3}$ due to         turbulent mixing and becomes dominant at column densities around         30-50 M$_{☉}$ pc$^{-2}$. The CO-to-H$_{2}$ ratio steadily         increases within the first 2 Myr, whereas X$_{CO}$ ≃ 1-4         {\texttimes} {}10$^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$ is         approximately constant since the CO(1-0) line quickly becomes         optically thick.},

We explore the origin of the linear slope of this         correlation using a suite of isolated \{L\}$_{\textbackslashstar         }$ galaxy simulations. We show that in simulations with         efficient feedback, the slope of the         \{\textbackslashdot\{\{\{{\ensuremath{\Sigma}}         \}\}\}\}$_{\textbackslashstar         }$\{--\}\{\{\{{\ensuremath{\Sigma}}         \}\}\}$_{\{\{\{H}$\}\}$_{2}$\} relation on kiloparsec scales is         insensitive to the slope of the         \{\textbackslashdot\{{\ensuremath{\rho}}         \}\}$_{\textbackslashstar }$\{--\}{\ensuremath{\rho}} relation         assumed at the resolution scale. We also find that the slope on         kiloparsec scales depends on the criteria used to identify star-         forming gas, with a linear slope arising in simulations that         identify star-forming gas using a virial parameter threshold.         This behavior can be understood using a simple theoretical model         based on conservation of interstellar gas mass as the gas cycles         between atomic, molecular, and star-forming states under the         influence of feedback and dynamical processes. In particular, we         show that the linear slope emerges when feedback efficiently         regulates and stirs the evolution of dense, molecular gas. We         show that the model also provides insights into the likely         origin of the relation between the SFR and molecular gas in real         galaxies on different scales.},

We find no evidence of contamination from a lower-         redshift interloper close to the line of sight in the high         signal-to-noise spectrum of Q1549-C25. Furthermore, the         morphology of Q1549-C25 in V $_{606}$, J $_{125}$, and H         $_{160}$ Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging reveals that the         object consists of a single, isolated component within 1″. In         combination, these data indicate Q1549-C25 as a clean         spectroscopic detection of LyC radiation, only the second such         object discovered to date at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 3. We model         the spectral energy distribution of Q1549-C25, finding evidence         of negligible dust extinction, an age (assuming continuous star         formation) of {\ensuremath{\sim}}1 Gyr, and a stellar mass of         \{M\}$_{* }$=7.9{\texttimes} \{10\}$^{9}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$. Although         it is not possible to derive strong constraints on the absolute         escape fraction of LyC emission, f $_{esc}$(LyC), from a single         object, we use simulations of intergalactic and circumgalactic         absorption to infer         \{f\}$_{\{\{esc}$\}\}(\{\{LyC\}\}){\ensuremath{\geq}}slant 0.51         at 95\% confidence.

	abstract = {Hydrogen in the Universe was (re)ionized between redshifts z         {\ensuremath{\approx}} 10 and z {\ensuremath{\approx}} 6. The         nature of the sources of the ionizing radiation is hotly         debated, with faint galaxies below current detection limits         regarded as prime candidates. Here, we consider a scenario in         which ionizing photons escape through channels punctured in the         interstellar medium by outflows powered by starbursts. We take         account of the observation that strong outflows occur only when         the star formation density is sufficiently high, and estimate         the galaxy-averaged escape fraction as a function of redshift         and luminosity from the resolved star formation surface         densities in the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulation.         We find that the fraction of ionizing photons that escape from         galaxies increases rapidly with redshift, reaching values of         5-20 per cent at z \&gt; 6, with the brighter galaxies having         higher escape fractions. Combining the dependence of escape         fraction on luminosity and redshift with the observed luminosity         function, we demonstrate that galaxies emit enough ionizing         photons to match the existing constraints on reionization while         also matching the observed ultraviolet-background post-         reionization. Our findings suggest that galaxies above the         current Hubble Space Telescope detection limit emit half of the         ionizing radiation required to reionize the Universe.},

	abstract = {Narrowband imaging of the rest-frame Lyman continuum (LyC) of galaxies         at z{\ensuremath{\sim}} 3.1 has produced a large number of         candidate LyC-emitting galaxies. These samples are contaminated         by galaxies at lower redshift. To better understand LyC escape,         we need an uncontaminated sample of galaxies that emit strongly         in the LyC. Here we present deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging         of five bright galaxies at z{\ensuremath{\sim}} 3.1 that had         previously been identified as candidate LyC emitters with         ground-based images. The WFC3 F336W images probe the LyC of         galaxies at z\textbackslashgt 3.06 and provide an order-of-         magnitude increase in spatial resolution over ground-based         imaging. The non-ionizing UV images often show multiple galaxies         (or components) within {\ensuremath{\sim}}         1$^{\textbackslashprime\textbackslashprime}$ of the candidate         LyC emission seen from the ground. In each case, only one of the         components is emitting light in the F336W filter, which would         indicate LyC escape if that component is at z\textbackslashgt         3.06. We use Keck/NIRSPEC near-IR spectroscopy to measure         redshifts of these components to distinguish LyC emitters from         foreground contamination. We find that two candidates are low-         redshift contaminants, one candidate had a previously         misidentified redshift, and the other two cannot be confirmed as         LyC emitters. The level of contamination is consistent with         previous estimates. For the galaxies with z\textbackslashgt         3.06, we derive strong 1{\ensuremath{\sigma}} limits on the         relative escape fraction between 0.07 and 0.09. We still do not         have a sample of definitive LyC emitters, and a much larger         study of low-luminosity galaxies is required. The combination of         high-resolution imaging and deep spectroscopy is critical for         distinguishing LyC emitters from foreground contaminants. <P         />Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W.

	abstract = {We present an analysis of star-forming gas cores in a smooth particle         hydrodynamics simulation of a giant molecular cloud. We identify         cores using their deep potential wells. This yields a smoother         distribution with clearer boundaries than density. Additionally,         this gives an indication of future collapse, as bound potential         cores (p-cores) represent the earliest stages of fragmentation         in molecular clouds. We find that the mass function of the         p-cores resembles the stellar initial mass function and the         observed clump mass function, although p-core masses         (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.7M$_{solar}$) are smaller         than typical density clumps. The bound p-cores are generally         subsonic, have internal substructure and are only quasi-         spherical. We see no evidence of massive bound cores supported         by turbulence. We trace the evolution of the p-cores forward in         time, and investigate the connection between the original p-core         mass and the stellar mass that formed from it. We find that         there is a poor correlation, with considerable scatter         suggesting accretion on to the core is dependent on more factors         than just the initial core mass. During the accretion process         the p-cores accrete from beyond the region first bound,         highlighting the importance of the core environment to its         subsequent evolution.},

For roughly isothermal collapse around {}10$^{4}$         K, we find that line trapping of Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} (H I         and He II) photons causes the polytropic exponent to stiffen to         values significantly above unity. Under the assumptions of zero         H$_{2}$ abundance and very modest pollution by metals         (\&lt;10$^{-4}$ solar), fragmentation is likely to be inhibited         for such an equation of state. We argue on purely thermodynamic         grounds that a single black hole of         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde(0.02-0.003)M$_{h}$ can form at         the center of a halo for z=10-20 when the free-fall time is less         than the time needed for a resonantly scattered         Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} photon to escape from the halo. The         absence of H$_{2}$ follows naturally from the high temperatures,         \&gt;{}10$^{4}$ K, that are attained when         Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} photons are trapped in the dense and         massive halos that we consider. An H$_{2}$-dissociating UV         background is needed if positive feedback effects on H$_{2}$         formation from X-rays occur. The black hole-to-baryon mass         fraction is suggestively close to what is required for these         intermediate-mass black holes, of mass         M$_{BH}$\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde{}10$^{4}$-{}10$^{6}$         M$_{solar}$, to act as seeds for forming the supermassive black         holes of mass         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.001M$_{spheroid}$ found in         galaxies today.},

Employing a         hierarchical, zoom-in procedure, we achieve sufficient numerical         resolution to follow the collapsing gas in the centre of the         minihalo up to number densities of {}10$^{12}$cm$^{-3}$. This         allows us to study the protostellar accretion on to the initial         hydrostatic core, which we represent as a growing sink particle,         in improved physical detail. The accretion process, and in         particular its termination, governs the final masses that were         reached by the first stars. The primordial initial mass         function, in turn, played an important role in determining to         what extent the first stars drove early cosmic evolution. We         continue our simulation for 5000yr after the first sink particle         has formed. During this time period, a disc-like configuration         is assembled around the first protostar. The disc is         gravitationally unstable, develops a pronounced spiral structure         and fragments into several other protostellar seeds. At the end         of the simulation, a small multiple system has formed, dominated         by a binary with masses \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde40 and         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10M$_{solar}$. If Pop III stars         were to form typically in binaries or small multiples, the         standard model of primordial star formation, where single,         isolated stars are predicted to form in minihaloes, would have         to be modified. This would have crucial consequences for the         observational signature of the first stars, such as their         nucleosynthetic pattern, and the gravitational wave emission         from possible Pop III black hole binaries.},

@article{Stamatellos2012,
	abstract = {Protostars grow in mass by accreting material through their discs, and         this accretion is initially their main source of luminosity. The         resulting radiative feedback heats the environments of young         protostars, and may thereby suppress further fragmentation and         star formation. There is growing evidence that the accretion of         material on to protostars is episodic rather than continuous;         most of it happens in short bursts that last up to a few hundred         years, whereas the intervals between these outbursts of         accretion could be thousands of years. We have developed a model         to include the effects of episodic accretion in simulations of         star formation. Episodic accretion results in episodic radiative         feedback, which heats and temporarily stabilizes the disc,         suppressing the growth of gravitational instabilities. However,         once an outburst has been terminated, the luminosity of the         protostar is low, and the disc cools rapidly. Provided that         there is enough time between successive outbursts, the disc may         become gravitationally unstable and fragment. The model suggests         that episodic accretion may allow disc fragmentation if (i) the         time between successive outbursts is longer than the dynamical         time-scale for the growth of gravitational instabilities (a few         kyr), and (ii) the quiescent accretion rate on to the protostar         is sufficiently low (at most a few times 10$^{-7}$ M$_{☉}$         yr$^{-1}$). We also find that after a few protostars form in the         disc, their own episodic accretion events shorten the intervals         between successive outbursts, and suppress further         fragmentation, thus limiting the number of objects forming in         the disc. We conclude that episodic accretion moderates the         effect of radiative feedback from young protostars on their         environments, and, under certain conditions, allows the         formation of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and planetary-mass         objects by fragmentation of protostellar discs.},

Our         models include the coupled effects of hydrodynamics and non-LTE         radiative transfer in spherically outflowing winds, including         the detailed effects of metal line blocking and line blanketing         on the radiative transfer and energy balance. Our grid of model         atmospheres is available on the World Wide Web. We incorporate         our hot-star models into our population synthesis code (STARS),         and we compute the time-dependent SEDs and resulting Lyc and He         I emission rates for evolving star clusters. We present results         for continuous and impulsive star formation for a range of         assumed stellar initial mass functions.},

@article{Truelove1997,
	abstract = {We demonstrate with a new three-dimensional adaptive mesh refinement         code that perturbations arising from discretization of the         equations of self-gravitational hydrodynamics can grow into         fragments in multiple-grid simulations, a process we term         ``artificial fragmentation.'' We present star formation         calculations of isothermal collapse of dense molecular cloud         cores. In simulation of a Gaussian-profile cloud free of applied         perturbations, we find artificial fragmentation can be avoided         across the isothermal density regime by ensuring the ratio of         cell size to Jeans length, which we call the Jeans number, J         {\ensuremath{\equiv}}         {\ensuremath{\Delta}}x/{\ensuremath{\lambda}}$_{J}$ , is kept         below 0.25. We refer to the constraint that         {\ensuremath{\lambda}}$_{J}$ be resolved as the Jeans condition.         When an m = 2 perturbation is included, we again find it         necessary to keep J \&lt;= 0.25 to achieve a converged         morphology. Collapse to a filamentary singularity occurs without         fragmentation of the filament, in agreement with the predictions         of Inutsuka \&amp; Miyama. Simulation beyond the time of this         singularity requires an arresting agent to slow the runaway         density growth. Physically, the breakdown of isothermality due         to the buildup of opacity acts as this agent, but many published         calculations have instead used artificial viscosity for this         purpose. Because artificial viscosity is resolution dependent,         such calculations produce resolution-dependent results. In the         context of the perturbed Gaussian cloud, we show that use of         artificial viscosity to arrest collapse results in significant         violation of the Jeans condition. We also show that if the         applied perturbation is removed from such a calculation,         numerical fluctuations grow to produce substantial fragments not         unlike those found when the perturbation is included. These         findings indicate that calculations that employ artificial         viscosity to halt collapse are susceptible to contamination by         artificial fragmentation. The Jeans condition has important         implications for numerical studies of isothermal self-         gravitational hydrodynamics problems insofar as it is a         necessary but not, in general, sufficient condition for         convergence.},

We have         observed a star-forming galaxy at z = 3.2 with Hubble/WFC3 in         the F336W filter, corresponding to the 730-890 {\r{A}} rest-         frame, and detected LyC emission. This galaxy is very compact         and also has a large Oxygen ratio [\{\{O\}\}         \{\{III\}\}]{\ensuremath{\lambda}} 5007/[\{\{O\}\}         \{\{II\}\}]{\ensuremath{\lambda}} 3727 ({\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}         10). No nuclear activity is revealed from optical/near-infrared         spectroscopy and deep multi-band photometry (including the 6 Ms         X-ray Chandra observations). The measured escape fraction of         ionizing radiation spans the range 50\%-100\%, depending on the         intergalactic medium (IGM) attenuation. The LyC emission is         measured at \{m\}$_{\{\{F}$\}336\{\{W\}\}\}=27.57+/- 0.11 (with         signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) = 10) and is spatially unresolved,         with an effective radius of \{R\}$_{e}$\textbackslashlt 200 pc.         Predictions from photoionization and radiative transfer models         are in line with the properties reported here, indicating that         stellar winds and supernova explosions in a nucleated star-         forming region can blow cavities generating density-bounded         conditions compatible to optically thin media. Irrespective of         the nature of the ionizing radiation, spectral signatures of         these sources over the entire electromagnetic spectrum are of         central importance for their identification during the epoch of         reionization when the LyC is unobservable.

@article{VazquezSemadeni1994,
	abstract = {A purely statistical origin of hierarchical density structure in         pressureless and nearly pressureless turbulent flows without         self-gravity is proposed. It is argued that hydrodynamic         (Navier-Stokes) flows with rms Mach numbers M$_{rms}$         {\ensuremath{\gg}} 1, like the cold interstellar medium or some         cosmological flows, have a nearly pressureless behavior, except         perhaps in a small fraction of the volume. Assuming that in         these flows the density field can be considered as a random         variable in time with an associated probability distribution         function (pdf), a condition on the pdf for the spontaneous         development of hierarchical structure is proposed. The condition         is essentially a requirement that the joint probability of a         succession of n constructively interfering relative density         fluctuations of amplitude a be larger than the probability of a         single, large fluctuation of the same final amplitude a . An         analytic form for this condition is derived, under the         assumption that the density pdf is scale- invariant, and three         important functional forms of the pdf (a power-law, a lognormal,         and an exponential distribution) are tested according to this         criterion. It is found that development of hierarchical         structure should always be expected for the lognormal and         exponential distributions at large values of n and/or a, but is         parameter-dependent in the case of the power law. The assumption         of a scale-invariant density pdf is motivated (but not         rigorously proved) by the scale invariance of the pressureless         hydrodynamic equations with negligible self-gravity, and a         numerical simulation of a compressible turbulent flow in two         dimensions in a transonic regime (M {\ensuremath{\sim}} 1) is         used to test this and other secondary assumptions. The density         field developed by the simulation clearly exhibits at least         three levels of hierarchical nesting. The density statistics,         albeit obscured by the limited resolution, which limits the         feasible density contrasts, are shown to be consistent with the         hypotheses. A discussion on the degree to which the dynamics of         two- and three-dimensional flows may differ from one another in         the compressible case is given. Finally, a remark is made that         the hierarchical structure produced by this mechanism in         turbulent compressible flows is transient although statistically         stationary. This should be the case of all non-self-gravitating         clouds in the cold interstellar medium and of small-scale         structures in cosmological flows.},

	abstract = {The relations between star formation and properties of molecular clouds         (MCs) are studied based on a sample of star-forming regions in         the Galactic Plane. Sources were selected by having radio         recombination lines to provide identification of associated MCs         and dense clumps. Radio continuum emission and mid-infrared         emission were used to determine star formation rates (SFRs),         while $^{13}$CO and submillimeter dust continuum emission were         used to obtain the masses of molecular and dense gas,         respectively. We test whether total molecular gas or dense gas         provides the best predictor of SFR. We also test two specific         theoretical models, one relying on the molecular mass divided by         the free-fall time, the other using the free-fall time divided         by the crossing time. Neither is supported by the data. The data         are also compared to those from nearby star-forming regions and         extragalactic data. The star formation         {\textquotedblleft}efficiency,{\textquotedblright} defined as         SFR divided by mass, spreads over a large range when the mass         refers to molecular gas; the standard deviation of the log of         the efficiency decreases by a factor of three when the mass of         relatively dense molecular gas is used rather than the mass of         all of the molecular gas.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate that the mass of the most massive star in a cluster         correlates non-trivially with the cluster mass. A simple         algorithm, according to which a cluster is filled up with stars         that are chosen randomly from the standard initial mass function         (IMF) but sorted with increasing mass, yields an excellent         description of the observational data. Algorithms based on         random sampling from the IMF without sorted adding are ruled out         with a confidence larger than 0.9999. A physical explanation of         this would be that a cluster forms by more-massive stars being         consecutively added until the resulting feedback energy suffices         to revert cloud contraction and stops further star formation.         This has important implications for composite populations. For         example, {}10$^{4}$ clusters of mass {}10$^{2}$M$_{solar}$ will         not produce the same IMF as one cluster with a mass of         {}10$^{6}$M$_{solar}$. It also supports the notion that the         integrated galaxial stellar IMF (IGIMF) should be steeper than         the stellar IMF and that it should vary with the star formation         rate of a galaxy.},

The size distributions include sufficient very small         carbonaceous grains (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon         molecules) to account for the observed infrared and microwave         emission from the diffuse interstellar medium. Our distributions         reproduce the observed extinction of starlight, which varies         depending on the interstellar environment through which the         light travels. As shown by Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis in         1989, these variations can be roughly parameterized by the ratio         of visual extinction to reddening, R$_{V}$. We adopt a fairly         simple functional form for the size distribution, characterized         by several parameters. We tabulate these parameters for various         combinations of values for R$_{V}$ and b$_{C}$, the C abundance         in very small grains. We also find size distributions for the         line of sight to HD 210121 and for sight lines in the LMC and         SMC. For several size distributions, we evaluate the albedo and         scattering asymmetry parameter and present model extinction         curves extending beyond the Lyman limit.},

@article{Willott2010,
	abstract = {We present discovery observations of a quasar in the Canada-France         High-z Quasar Survey (CFHQS) at redshift z = 6.44. We also use         near-infrared spectroscopy of nine CFHQS quasars at z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 6 to determine black hole         masses. These are compared with similar estimates for more         luminous Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars to investigate the         relationship between black hole mass and quasar luminosity. We         find a strong correlation between Mg II FWHM and UV luminosity         and that most quasars at this early epoch are accreting close to         the Eddington limit. Thus, these quasars appear to be in an         early stage of their life cycle where they are building up their         black hole mass exponentially. Combining these results with the         quasar luminosity function, we derive the black hole mass         function at z = 6. Our black hole mass function is         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde{}10$^{4}$ times lower than at z         = 0 and substantially below estimates from previous studies. The         main uncertainties which could increase the black hole mass         function are a larger population of obscured quasars at high         redshift than is observed at low redshift and/or a low quasar         duty cycle at z = 6. In comparison, the global stellar mass         function is only \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde{}10$^{2}$         times lower at z = 6 than at z = 0. The difference between the         black hole and stellar mass function evolution is due to either         rapid early star formation which is not limited by radiation         pressure as is the case for black hole growth or inefficient         black hole seeding. Our work predicts that the black hole mass-         stellar mass relation for a volume-limited sample of galaxies         declines rapidly at very high redshift. This is in contrast to         the observed increase at 4 \&lt; z \&lt; 6 from the local         relation if one just studies the most massive black holes.},

	abstract = {It has been argued that low-luminosity dwarf galaxies are the dominant         source of ionizing radiation during cosmological reionization.         The fraction of ionizing radiation that escapes into the         intergalactic medium from dwarf galaxies with masses less than         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10$^{9.5}$ solar masses plays a         critical role during this epoch. Using an extensive suite of         very high resolution (0.1 pc), adaptive mesh refinement,         radiation hydrodynamical simulations of idealized and         cosmological dwarf galaxies, we characterize the behavior of the         escape fraction in galaxies between 3 {\texttimes} {}10$^{6}$         and 3 {\texttimes} {}10$^{9}$ solar masses with different spin         parameters, amounts of turbulence, and baryon mass fractions.         For a given halo mass, escape fractions can vary up to a factor         of two, depending on the initial setup of the idealized halo. In         a cosmological setting, we find that the time-averaged photon         escape fraction always exceeds 25\% and reaches up to 80\% in         halos with masses above {}10$^{8}$ solar masses with a top-heavy         initial mass function (IMF). The instantaneous escape fraction         can vary up to an order of magnitude in a few million years and         tends to be positively correlated with star formation rate. We         find that the mean of the star formation efficiency times         ionizing photon escape fraction, averaged over all atomic         cooling (T $_{vir}$ \&gt;= 8000 K) galaxies, ranges from 0.02         for a normal IMF to 0.03 for a top-heavy IMF, whereas smaller,         molecular cooling galaxies in minihalos do not make a         significant contribution to reionizing the universe due to much         lower star formation rates. These results provide the physical         basis for cosmological reionization by stellar sources,         predominately atomic cooling dwarf galaxies.},

We present the statistics of dwarf galaxy         properties at z \&gt; 7 in haloes with masses up to {}10$^{9}$         M$_{☉}$, using a cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation         that follows their buildup starting with their Population III         progenitors. We find that metal-enriched star formation is not         restricted to atomic cooling (T$_{vir}$ {\ensuremath{\geq}}         {}10$^{4}$ K) haloes, but can occur in haloes down to masses         {\ensuremath{\sim}}{}10$^{6}$ M$_{☉}$, especially in neutral         regions. Even though these smallest galaxies only host up to         {}10$^{4}$ M$_{☉}$ of stars, they provide nearly 30 per cent of         the ionizing photon budget. We find that the galaxy luminosity         function flattens above M$_{UV}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} -12 with a         number density that is unchanged at z {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}         10. The fraction of ionizing radiation escaping into the         intergalactic medium is inversely dependent on halo mass,         decreasing from 50 to 5 per cent in the mass range log M/M$_{☉}$         = 7.0-8.5. Using our galaxy statistics in a semi-analytic         reionization model, we find a Thomson scattering optical depth         consistent with the latest Planck results, while still being         consistent with the UV emissivity constraints provided by         Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} forest observations at z = 4-6.},

	abstract = {The origin of the supermassive black holes that inhabit the centres of         massive galaxies remains unclear$^{1,2}$. Direct-collapse black         holes{\textemdash}remnants of supermassive stars, with masses         around 10,000 times that of the Sun{\textemdash}are ideal seed         candidates$^{3-6}$. However, their very existence and their         formation environment in the early Universe are still under         debate, and their supposed rarity makes modelling their         formation difficult$^{7,8}$. Models have shown that rapid         collapse of pre-galactic gas (with a mass infall rate above some         critical value) in metal-free haloes is a requirement for the         formation of a protostellar core that will then form a         supermassive star$^{9,10}$. Here we report a radiation         hydrodynamics simulation of early galaxy formation$^{11,12}$         that produces metal-free haloes massive enough and with         sufficiently high mass infall rates to form supermassive stars.         We find that pre-galactic haloes and their associated gas clouds         that are exposed to a Lyman-Werner intensity roughly three times         the intensity of the background radiation and that undergo at         least one period of rapid mass growth early in their evolution         are ideal environments for the formation of supermassive stars.         The rapid growth induces substantial dynamical         heating$^{13,14}$, amplifying the Lyman-Werner suppression that         originates from a group of young galaxies 20 kiloparsecs away.         Our results strongly indicate that the dynamics of structure         formation, rather than a critical Lyman-Werner flux, is the main         driver of the formation of massive black holes in the early         Universe. We find that the seeds of massive black holes may be         much more common than previously considered in overdense regions         of the early Universe, with a co-moving number density up to         10$^{-3}$ per cubic megaparsec.},

	abstract = {The universe goes through several phase transitions during its formative         stages. Cosmic reionization is the last of them, where         ultraviolet and X-ray radiation escape from the first         generations of galaxies heating and ionizing their surroundings         and subsequently the entire intergalactic medium. There is         strong observational evidence that cosmic reionization ended         approximately one billion years after the Big Bang, but there         are still uncertainties that will be clarified with upcoming         optical, infrared, and radio facilities in the next decade. This         article gives an introduction to the theoretical and         observational aspects of cosmic reionization and discusses their         role in our understanding of early galaxy formation and         cosmology.},

	abstract = {Due to their long mean free path, X-rays are expected to have an         important impact on cosmic reionization by heating and ionizing         the intergalactic medium (IGM) on large scales, especially after         simulations have suggested that Population III (Pop III) stars         may form in pairs at redshifts as high as 20-30. We use the Pop         III distribution and evolution from a self-consistent         cosmological radiation hydrodynamic simulation of the formation         of the first galaxies and a simple Pop III X-ray binary model to         estimate their X-ray output in a high-density region larger than         100 comoving (Mpc)$^{3}$. We then combine three different         methods{\textemdash}ray tracing, a one-zone model, and X-ray         background modeling{\textemdash}to investigate the X-ray         propagation, intensity distribution, and long-term effects on         the IGM thermal and ionization state. The efficiency and         morphology of photoheating and photoionization are dependent on         the photon energies. The sub-kiloelectronvolt X-rays only impact         the IGM near the sources, while the kiloelectronvolt photons         contribute significantly to the X-ray background and heat and         ionize the IGM smoothly. The X-rays just below 1 keV are most         efficient in heating and ionizing the IGM. We find that the IGM         might be heated to over 100 K by z = 10 and the high-density         source region might reach {}10$^{4}$ K, limited by atomic         hydrogen cooling. This may be important for predicting the 21 cm         neutral hydrogen signals. On the other hand, the free electrons         from X-ray ionizations are not enough to contribute         significantly to the optical depth of the cosmic microwave         background to the Thomson scattering.},

	abstract = {Cosmic reionization is thought to be primarily fueled by the first         generations of galaxies. We examine their stellar and gaseous         properties, focusing on the star formation rates and the escape         of ionizing photons, as a function of halo mass, redshift, and         environment using the full suite of the Renaissance Simulations         with an eye to provide better inputs to global reionization         simulations. This suite probes overdense, average, and         underdense regions of the universe of several hundred comoving         Mpc$^{3}$, each yielding a sample of over 3000 halos in the mass         range of {}10$^{7}$-10$^{9.5}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$ at their final         redshifts of 15, 12.5, and 8, respectively. In the process, we         simulate the effects of radiative and supernova feedback from         5000 to 10,000 Population III stars in each simulation. We find         that halos as small as {}10$^{7}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$ are able to host         bursty star formation due to metal-line cooling from earlier         enrichment by massive Population III stars. Using our large         sample, we find that the galaxy-halo occupation fraction drops         from unity at virial masses above 10$^{8.5}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$ to         {\ensuremath{\sim}}50\% at {}10$^{8}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$ and         {\ensuremath{\sim}}10\% at {}10$^{7}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$, quite         independent of redshift and region. Their average ionizing         escape fraction is {\ensuremath{\sim}}5\% in the mass range of         {}10$^{8}$-{}10$^{9}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$ and increases with decreasing         halo mass below this range, reaching 40\%-60\% at {}10$^{7}$         \{M\}$_{☉ }$. Interestingly, we find that the escape fraction         varies between 10\%-20\% in halos with virial masses of         {\ensuremath{\sim}}3 {\texttimes} {}10$^{9}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$. Taken         together, our results confirm the importance of the smallest         galaxies as sources of ionizing radiation contributing to the         reionization of the universe.},

	abstract = {In order to assess the contribution of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and         Lyman {\ensuremath{\alpha}} emitters (LAEs) at redshifts 3 \&lt;         z \&lt; 7 to the ionization of intergalactic medium (IGM), we         investigate the escape fractions of ionizing photons from         supernova-dominated primordial galaxies by solving the three-         dimensional (3D) radiative transfer. The model galaxy is         employed from an ultra-high-resolution chemodynamic simulation         of a primordial galaxy by Mori \&amp; Umemura, which well         reproduces the observed properties of LAEs and LBGs. The total         mass of model galaxy is {}10$^{11}$M$_{solar}$. We solve not         only photoionization but also collisional ionization by shocks.         In addition, according to the chemical enrichment, we         incorporate the effect of dust extinction, taking the size         distributions of dust into account. As a result, we find that         dust extinction reduces the escape fractions by a factor of         1.5-8.5 in the LAE phase and by a factor of 2.5-11 in the LBG         phase, while the collisional ionization by shocks increases the         escape fractions by a factor of         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2. The resultant escape         fractions are 0.07-0.47 in the LAE phase and 0.06-0.17 in the         LBG phase. These results are well concordant with the recent         estimations derived from the flux density ratio at 1500 to 900         {\r{A}} of LAEs and LBGs. Combining the resultant escape         fractions with the luminosity functions of LAEs and LBGs, we         find that high-z LAEs and LBGs can ionize the IGM at z = 3-5.         However, ionizing radiation from LAEs as well as LBGs falls         short of ionizing the IGM at z \&gt; 6. That implies that         additional ionization sources may be required at z \&gt; 6.},

@article{Yajima2011,
	abstract = {Combing the three-dimensional radiative transfer (RT) calculation and         cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations,         we study the escape fraction of ionizing photons (f$_{esc}$) of         high-redshift galaxies at z= 3-6. Our simulations cover the halo         mass range of M$_{h}$= {}10$^{9}$-{}10$^{12}$ M$_{☉}$. We post-         process several hundred simulated galaxies with the Authentic         Radiative Transfer (ART) code to study the halo mass dependence         of f$_{esc}$. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to the         transfer of stellar radiation from local stellar population in         each dark matter halo. We find that the average f$_{esc}$         steeply decreases as the halo mass increases, with a large         scatter for the lower-mass haloes. The low-mass haloes with         M$_{h}${\ensuremath{\sim}} {}10$^{9}$ M$_{☉}$ have large values         of f$_{esc}$ (with an average of {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.4),         whereas the massive haloes with M$_{h}${\ensuremath{\sim}}         {}10$^{11}$ M$_{☉}$ show small values of f$_{esc}$ (with an         average of {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.07). This is because in our         simulations, the massive haloes show more clumpy structure in         gas distribution, and the star-forming regions are embedded         inside these clumps, making it more difficult for the ionizing         photons to escape. On the other hand, in low-mass haloes, there         are often conical regions of highly ionized gas due to the         shifted location of young star clusters from the centre of dark         matter halo, which allows the ionizing photons to escape more         easily than in the high-mass haloes. By counting the number of         escaped ionizing photons, we show that the star-forming galaxies         can ionize the intergalactic medium at z= 3-6. The main         contributor to the ionizing photons is the haloes with         M$_{h}${\ensuremath{\lesssim}} {}10$^{10}$ M$_{☉}$ owing to         their high f$_{esc}$. The large dispersion in f$_{esc}$ suggests         that there may be various sizes of H II bubbles around the         haloes even with the same mass in the early stages of         reionization. We also examine the effect of UV background         radiation field on f$_{esc}$ using simple, four different         treatments of UV background.},

Under         the assumption of compact star cluster formation in merging         galaxies, star clusters in haloes of {\ensuremath{\sim}}         {}10$^{8}$-{}10$^{9}$ M$_{☉}$ can undergo rapid core collapse,         leading to the formation of very massive stars (VMSs) of         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 1000 M$_{☉}$ that collapse directly into         black holes with similar masses. Star clusters in haloes of         {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} {}10$^{9}$ M$_{☉}$ experience Type II         supernovae before the formation of VMSs, due to long core-         collapse time-scales. We also model the subsequent growth of         black holes via accretion of residual stars in clusters. Two-         body relaxation refills the loss cones of stellar orbits         efficiently at larger radii and resonant relaxation at small         radii is the main driver for accretion of stars on to black         holes. As a result, more than 90 percent of stars in the initial         cluster are swallowed by the central black holes before z = 6.         Using dark matter merger trees, we derive black hole mass         functions at z = 6-20. The mass function ranges from         {}10$^{3}$-{}10$^{5}$ M$_{☉}$ at z {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 15.         Major merging of galaxies of {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 4         {\texttimes} {}10$^{8}$ M$_{☉}$ at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 20         leads successfully to the formation of {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}         {}10$^{5}$ M$_{☉}$ black holes by z {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 10,         which could be the potential seeds of supermassive black holes         seen today.},

	abstract = {Evidence for dust around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early         universe is strongly suggested by recent observations. However,         the accretion mechanism of SMBHs in dusty gas is not well         understood yet. We investigate the growth of intermediate-mass         black holes (IMBHs) of {\ensuremath{\sim}}         \{10\}$^{4}$\{--\}\{10\}$^{6}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$ in dusty clouds by         using one-dimensional radiative-hydrodynamics simulations. We         find that the accretion of dusty gas onto IMBHs proceeds gently         with small fluctuations of the accretion rate, whereas that of         pristine gas causes more violent periodic bursts. At dust-to-gas         mass ratios similar to the solar neighborhood, the time-averaged         luminosity becomes smaller than that for primordial gas by one         order of magnitude and the time-averaged Eddington ratio ranges         from {\ensuremath{\sim}} \{10\}$^{-4}$ to {\ensuremath{\sim}}         \{10\}$^{-2}$ in clouds with initial gas densities of         \{n\}$_{\{\{H}$\}\}=10\{--\}1000 \{\{cm\}\}$^{-3}$. Our         calculations show that the effect of dust opacity alone is         secondary compared to the radiation pressure on dust in         regulating the BH growth. We also derive spectral energy         distributions at IR bands by calculating dust thermal emission         and show that the flux ratio between {\ensuremath{\lambda}}         {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 20 {\ensuremath{\mu}} \{\{m\}\} and         {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 100 {\ensuremath{\mu}} \{\{m\}\} is         closely related to the Eddington ratio. Thermal emission from         hot dust near the BH dominates only during the phase of high         accretion, producing higher flux density at         {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 20 {\ensuremath{\mu}} \{\{m\}\}.         Therefore, we suggest that a combination of mid-IR observations         by the James Webb Space Telescope and far-IR observations by         ALMA or Spitzer can be used to estimate the Eddington ratio of         massive BHs. We also extend our simple modeling to SMBHs of         \{10\}$^{8}$\{--\}\{10\}$^{9}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$ and show that ALMA         can detect SMBHs of {\ensuremath{\sim}} \{10\}$^{9}$ \{M\}$_{☉         }$ at z{\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 5.},

	abstract = {The Universe's dark ages end with the formation of the first generation         of galaxies. These objects start emitting ultraviolet radiation         that carves out ionized regions around them. After a sufficient         number of ionizing sources have formed, the ionized fraction of         the gas in the Universe rapidly increases until hydrogen becomes         fully ionized. This period, during which the cosmic gas went         from neutral to ionized, is known as the Universe's Epoch of         Reionization. The Epoch of Reionization is related to many         fundamental questions in cosmology, such as properties of the         first galaxies, physics of (mini-)quasars, formation of very         metal-poor stars and a slew of other important research topics         in astrophysics. Hence uncovering it will have far reaching         implications on the study of structure formation in the early         Universe. This chapter reviews the current observational         evidence for the occurrence of this epoch, its key theoretical         aspects and main characteristics, and finally the various         observational probes that promise to uncover it. A special         emphasis is put on the redshifted 21 cm probe, the various         experiments that are currently being either built or designed,         and what we can learn from them about the Epoch of Reionization.},

	abstract = {GAMER, a parallel Graphic-processing-unit-accelerated Adaptive-MEsh-         Refinement (AMR) hydrodynamic code, has been extended to support         magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with both the corner-transport-upwind         and MUSCL-Hancock schemes and the constraint transport         technique. The divergent preserving operator for AMR has been         applied to reinforce the divergence-free constraint on the         magnetic field. GAMER-MHD has fully exploited the concurrent         executions between the graphic process unit (GPU) MHD solver and         other central processing unit computation pertinent to AMR. We         perform various standard tests to demonstrate that GAMER-MHD is         both second-order accurate and robust, producing results as         accurate as those given by high-resolution uniform-grid runs. We         also explore a new 3D MHD test, where the magnetic field assumes         the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress configuration, temporarily becomes         turbulent with current sheets, and finally settles to a lowest-         energy equilibrium state. This 3D problem is adopted for the         performance test of GAMER-MHD. The single-GPU performance         reaches 1.2 {\texttimes} {}10$^{8}$ and 5.5 {\texttimes}         {}10$^{7}$ cell updates per second for the single- and double-         precision calculations, respectively, on Tesla P100. We also         demonstrate a parallel efficiency of {\ensuremath{\sim}}70\% for         both weak and strong scaling using 1024 XK nodes on the Blue         Waters supercomputers.},

	abstract = {We report the statistical properties of stars and brown dwarfs obtained         from four radiation hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster         formation, the metallicities of which span a range from 1/100 to         3 times the solar value. Unlike previous similar investigations         of the effects of metallicity on stellar properties, these new         calculations treat dust and gas temperatures separately and         include a thermochemical model of the diffuse interstellar         medium. The more advanced treatment of the interstellar medium         gives rise to very different gas and dust temperature         distributions in the four calculations, with lower metallicities         generally resulting in higher temperatures and a delay in the         onset of star formation. Despite this, once star formation         begins, all four calculations produce stars at similar rates and         many of the statistical properties of their stellar populations         are difficult to distinguish from each other and from those of         observed stellar systems. We do find, however, that the greater         cooling rates at high gas densities due to the lower opacities         at low metallicities increase the fragmentation on small spatial         scales (disc, filament, and core fragmentation). This produces         an anticorrelation between the close binary fraction of low-mass         stars and metallicity similar to that which is observed, and an         increase in the fraction of protostellar mergers at low         metallicities. There are also indications that at lower         metallicity close binaries may have lower mass ratios and the         abundance of brown dwarfs to stars may increase slightly.         However, these latter two effects are quite weak and need to be         confirmed with larger samples.},

	abstract = {We describe a phenomenological model for molecular hydrogen formation         suited for applications in galaxy formation simulations, which         includes nonequilibrium formation of H$_{2}$ on dust and         approximate treatment of both its self-shielding and shielding         by dust from the dissociating UV radiation. The model is         applicable in simulations in which individual star-forming         regions{\textemdash}the giant molecular         complexes{\textemdash}can be identified (resolution of tens of         parsecs) and their mean internal density estimated reliably,         even if internal structure is not resolved. In agreement with         previous studies, calculations based on our model show that the         transition from atomic to fully molecular phase depends         primarily on the metallicity, which we assume is directly         related to the dust abundance, and clumpiness of the         interstellar medium. The clumpiness simply boosts the formation         rate of molecular hydrogen, while dust serves both as a catalyst         of H$_{2}$ formation and as an additional shielding from         dissociating UV radiation. The upshot is that it is difficult to         form fully shielded giant molecular clouds while gas metallicity         is low. However, once the gas is enriched to Z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.01-0.1 Z $_{sun}$, the         subsequent star formation and enrichment can proceed at a much         faster rate. This may keep star formation efficiency in the low-         mass, low-metallicity progenitors of galaxies very low for a         certain period of time with the effect similar to a strong         ``feedback'' mechanism. The effect may help explain the steep         increase of the mass-to-light ratio toward smaller masses         observed in the local galaxy population. We apply the model and         star formation recipes based on the local amount of molecular         gas to an output from a cosmological simulation of galaxy         formation and show that resulting global correlations between         star formation and gas, and H$_{2}$ surface densities are in         good agreement with observations.},

	abstract = {We model the escape of ionizing radiation from high-redshift galaxies         using high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement N-body +         hydrodynamics simulations. Our simulations include the time-         dependent and spatially resolved transfer of ionizing radiation         in three dimensions, including the effects of dust absorption.         For galaxies of total mass Mgtrsim {}10$^{11}$ M$_{☉}$ and star         formation rates SFR {\ensuremath{\approx}} 1-5 M$_{☉}$         yr$^{-1}$, we find angular averaged escape fractions of 1\%-3\%         over the entire redshift interval studied (3 \&lt; z \&lt; 9).         In addition, we find that the escape fraction varies by more         than an order of magnitude along different lines of sight within         individual galaxies, from the largest values near galactic poles         to the smallest along the galactic disk. The escape fraction         declines steeply at lower masses and SFR. We show that the low         values of escape fractions are due to a small fraction of young         stars located just outside the edge of the H I disk. This         fraction, and hence the escape fraction, is progressively         smaller in disks of smaller galaxies because their H I disks are         thicker and more extended relative to the distribution of young         stars compared to massive galaxies. We compare our predicted         escape fraction of ionizing photons with previous results and         find a general agreement with both other simulation results and         available direct detection measurements at z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 3. We also compare our         simulations with a novel method to estimate the escape fraction         in galaxies from the observed distribution of neutral hydrogen         column densities along the lines of sight to long-duration         {\ensuremath{\gamma}}-ray bursts (GRBs). Using this method we         find escape fractions of the GRB host galaxies of 2\%-3\%,         consistent with our theoretical predictions. Our results thus         suggest that high-redshift galaxies are inefficient in releasing         ionizing radiation produced by young stars into the         intergalactic medium.},

	abstract = {Star clusters stand at the intersection of much of modern astrophysics:         the ISM, gravitational dynamics, stellar evolution, and         cosmology. Here, we review observations and theoretical models         for the formation, evolution, and eventual disruption of star         clusters. Current literature suggests a picture of this life         cycle including the following several phases: Clusters form in         hierarchically structured, accreting molecular clouds that         convert gas into stars at a low rate per dynamical time until         feedback disperses the gas. The densest parts of the hierarchy         resist gas removal long enough to reach high star-formation         efficiency, becoming dynamically relaxed and well mixed. These         remain bound after gas removal. In the first         {\ensuremath{\sim}}100 Myr after gas removal, clusters disperse         moderately fast, through a combination of mass loss and tidal         shocks by dense molecular structures in the star-forming         environment. After {\ensuremath{\sim}}100 Myr, clusters lose         mass via two-body relaxation and shocks by giant molecular         clouds, processes that preferentially affect low-mass clusters         and cause a turnover in the cluster mass function to appear on         {\ensuremath{\sim}}1-10-Gyr timescales. Even after dispersal,         some clusters remain coherent and thus detectable in chemical or         action space for multiple galactic orbits.In the next decade, a         new generation of space- and adaptive optics-assisted ground-         based telescopes will enable us to test and refine this picture.},

	abstract = {In this paper, I investigate the processes that regulate the rate of         star formation in regions of galaxies where the neutral         interstellar medium is predominantly composed of non-star-         forming H I. In such regions, found today predominantly in low-         metallicity dwarf galaxies and in the outer parts of large         spirals, the star formation rate per unit area and per unit mass         is much smaller than in more molecule-rich regions. While in         molecule-rich regions the ultraviolet radiation field produced         by efficient star formation forces the density of the cold         neutral medium to a value set by two-phase equilibrium, I show         that the low rates of star formation found in molecule-poor         regions preclude this condition. Instead, the density of the         cold neutral gas is set by the requirements of hydrostatic         balance. Using this result, I extend the Krumholz et al. model         for star formation and the atomic to molecular transition to the         molecule-poor regime. This `KMT+' model matches a wide range of         observations of the star formation rate and the balance between         the atomic and molecular phases in dwarfs and in the outer parts         of spirals, and is well suited to implementation as a subgrid         recipe for star formation in cosmological simulations and semi-         analytic models. I discuss the implications of this model for         star formation over cosmological times.},

	abstract = {The distribution of stellar masses that form in one star formation event         in a given volume of space is called the initial mass function         (IMF). The IMF has been estimated from low-mass brown dwarfs to         very massive stars. Combining IMF estimates for different         populations in which the stars can be observed individually         unveils an extraordinary uniformity of the IMF. This general         insight appears to hold for populations including present-day         star formation in small molecular clouds, rich and dense massive         star-clusters forming in giant clouds, through to ancient and         metal-poor exotic stellar populations that may be dominated by         dark matter. This apparent universality of the IMF is a         challenge for star formation theory, because elementary         considerations suggest that the IMF ought to systematically vary         with star-forming conditions.},

	abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs)         and during their formation and early evolution are often only         visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust.         Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection         capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of         embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article         we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning         these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the         literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic         embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass         function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within         2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate         exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude         or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster         systems. Less than 4-7\% of embedded clusters survive emergence         from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age.         The vast majority (90\%) of stars that form in embedded clusters         form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in         excess of 50 M$_{☉}$. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud         complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a         significant (70-90\%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We         review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature         of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example,         has been measured over the entire range of stellar and         substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the         deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded         clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk         evolution and the important constraints they provide for         understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we         discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical         evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the         formation of bound open clusters.},

	abstract = {Context. Even though turbulent motions are found everywhere in         astrophysical systems, the origin of this turbulence is poorly         understood. When cosmic structures form, they grow in mass via         accretion from their surrounding environment. <BR /> Aims: We         propose that accretion is able to drive internal turbulent         motions in a wide range of astrophysical objects and study this         process in the case of galaxies, molecular clouds, and         protoplanetary disks. <BR /> Methods: We use a combination of         numerical simulations and analytical arguments to predict the         level of turbulence as a function of the accretion rate, the         dissipation scale, and the density contrast, and compare our         models with observational data. <BR /> Results: We find that in         Milky Way type galaxies the observed level of turbulence in the         interstellar medium can be explained by accretion, provided that         the galaxies gain mass at a rate comparable to the rate at which         they form stars. This process is particularly relevant in the         extended outer disks beyond the star-forming radius. For it to         drive turbulence in dwarf galaxies, the accretion rate needs to         exceed the star formation rate by a large factor, so we expect         other sources to dominate. We also calculate the rate at which         molecular clouds grow in mass when they build up from the atomic         component of the galactic gas and find that their internal         turbulence is likely to be driven by accretion as well. It is         the very process of cloud formation that excites turbulent         motions on small scales by establishing the turbulent cascade.         In the case of T Tauri disks, we show that accretion can drive         subsonic turbulence if the rate at which gas falls onto the disk         is comparable to the rate at which disk material accretes onto         the central star. This also explains the observed relation of         accretion rate and stellar mass, dot\{M\} {\ensuremath{\propto}}         M\_star$^{1.8}$. The efficiency required to convert infall         motion into turbulence is a few percent in all three cases. <BR         /> Conclusions: We conclude that accretion-driven turbulence is         a universal concept with far-reaching implications for a wide         range of astrophysical objects.},

	abstract = {Context. Understanding the origin of the initial mass function (IMF) of         stars is a major problem for the star formation process and         beyond. Aim. We investigate the dependence of the peak of the         IMF on the physics of the so-called first Larson core, which         corresponds to the point where the dust becomes opaque to its         own radiation. <BR /> Methods: We performed numerical         simulations of collapsing clouds of 1000 M$_{☉}$ for various gas         equations of state (eos), paying great attention to the         numerical resolution and convergence. The initial conditions of         these numerical experiments are varied in the companion paper.         We also develop analytical models that we compare to our         numerical results. <BR /> Results: When an isothermal eos is         used, we show that the peak of the IMF shifts to lower masses         with improved numerical resolution. When an adiabatic eos is         employed, numerical convergence is obtained. The peak position         varies with the eos, and using an analytical model to infer the         mass of the first Larson core, we find that the peak position is         about ten times its value. By analyzing the stability of         nonlinear density fluctuations in the vicinity of a point mass         and then summing over a reasonable density distribution, we find         that tidal forces exert a strong stabilizing effect and likely         lead to a preferential mass several times higher than that of         the first Larson core. <BR /> Conclusions: We propose that in a         sufficiently massive and cold cloud, the peak of the IMF is         determined by the thermodynamics of the high-density adiabatic         gas as well as the stabilizing influence of tidal forces. The         resulting characteristic mass is about ten times the mass of the         first Larson core, which altogether leads to a few tenths of         solar masses. Since these processes are not related to the         large-scale physical conditions and to the environment, our         results suggest a possible explanation for the apparent         universality of the peak of the IMF.},

	abstract = {Context. Stars constitute the building blocks of our Universe, and their         formation is an astrophysical problem of great importance. Aim.         We aim to understand the fragmentation of massive molecular         star-forming clumps and the effect of initial conditions, namely         the density and the level of turbulence, on the resulting         distribution of stars. For this purpose, we conduct numerical         experiments in which we systematically vary the initial density         over four orders of magnitude and the turbulent velocity over a         factor ten. In a companion paper, we investigate the dependence         of this distribution on the gas thermodynamics. <BR /> Methods:         We performed a series of hydrodynamical numerical simulations         using adaptive mesh refinement, with special attention to         numerical convergence. We also adapted an existing analytical         model to the case of collapsing clouds by employing a density         probability distribution function (PDF)         {\ensuremath{\propto}}{\ensuremath{\rho}}$^{-1.5}$ instead of a         lognormal distribution. <BR /> Results: Simulations and         analytical model both show two support regimes, a thermally         dominated regime and a turbulence-dominated regime. For the         first regime, we infer that dN/d logM {\ensuremath{\propto}}         M$^{0}$, while for the second regime, we obtain dN/d logM         {\ensuremath{\propto}} M$^{-3/4}$. This is valid up to about ten         times the mass of the first Larson core, as explained in the         companion paper, leading to a peak of the mass spectrum at 0.2         M$_{☉}$. From this point, the mass spectrum decreases with         decreasing mass except for the most diffuse clouds, where disk         fragmentation leads to the formation of objects down to the mass         of the first Larson core, that is, to a few 10$^{-2}$ M$_{☉}$.         <BR /> Conclusions: Although the mass spectra we obtain for the         most compact clouds qualitatively resemble the observed initial         mass function, the distribution exponent is shallower than the         expected Salpeter exponent of - 1.35. Nonetheless, we observe a         possible transition toward a slightly steeper value that is         broadly compatible with the Salpeter exponent for masses above a         few solar masses. This change in behavior is associated with the         change in density PDF, which switches from a power-law to a         lognormal distribution. Our results suggest that while         gravitationally induced fragmentation could play an important         role for low masses, it is likely the turbulently induced         fragmentation that leads to the Salpeter exponent.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the level of star formation activity         within nearby molecular clouds. We employ a uniform set of         infrared extinction maps to provide accurate assessments of         cloud mass and structure and compare these with inventories of         young stellar objects within the clouds. We present evidence         indicating that both the yield and rate of star formation can         vary considerably in local clouds, independent of their mass and         size. We find that the surface density structure of such clouds         appears to be important in controlling both these factors. In         particular, we find that the star formation rate (SFR) in         molecular clouds is linearly proportional to the cloud mass (M         $_{0.8}$) above an extinction threshold of A $_{ K         }${\ensuremath{\approx}} 0.8 mag, corresponding to a gas surface         density threshold of {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{gas}$         {\ensuremath{\approx}} 116 M $_{sun}$ pc$^{2}$. We argue that         this surface density threshold corresponds to a gas volume         density threshold which we estimate to be n(H$_{2}$)         {\ensuremath{\approx}} {}10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$. Specifically, we         find SFR (M $_{sun}$ yr$^{-1}$) = 4.6 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2.6         {\texttimes} 10$^{-8}$ M $_{0.8}$ (M $_{sun}$) for the clouds in         our sample. This relation between the rate of star formation and         the amount of dense gas in molecular clouds appears to be in         excellent agreement with previous observations of both galactic         and extragalactic star-forming activity. It is likely the         underlying physical relationship or empirical law that most         directly connects star formation activity with interstellar gas         over many spatial scales within and between individual galaxies.         These results suggest that the key to obtaining a predictive         understanding of the SFRs in molecular clouds and galaxies is to         understand those physical factors which give rise to the dense         components of these clouds.},

	abstract = {We present realistic models for massive Population III stars and stellar         populations based on non-LTE model atmospheres, recent stellar         evolution tracks and up-to-date evolutionary synthesis models,         with the aim to study their spectral properties, including their         dependence on age, star formation history, and IMF. A comparison         of plane parallel non-LTE model atmospheres and comoving frame         calculations shows that even in the presence of some putative         weak mass loss, the ionising spectra of metal-free populations         differ little or negligibly from those obtained using plane         parallel non-LTE models. As already discussed by Tumlinson         \&amp; Shull (\textbackslashcite\{Tum00\}), the main salient         property of Pop III stars is their increased ionising flux,         especially in the He$^{+}$ continuum (\&gt;54 eV). The main         result obtained for individual Pop III stars is the following:         due to their redward evolution off the zero age main sequence         (ZAMS) the spectral hardness measured by the He$^{+}$ /H         ionising flux is decreased by a factor         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2 when averaged over their         lifetime. If such stars would suffer strong mass loss, their         spectral appearance could, however, remain similar to that of         their ZAMS position. The main results regarding integrated         stellar populations are: - for young bursts and the case of a         constant SFR, nebular continuous emission - neglected in         previous studies - dominates the spectrum redward of Lyman-alpha         if the escape fraction of ionising photons out of the considered         region is small or negligible. In consequence predicted emission         line equivalent widths are considerably smaller than found in         earlier studies, whereas the detection of the continuum is         eased. Nebular line and continuous emission strongly affect the         broad band photometric properties of Pop III objects; - due to         the redward stellar evolution and short lifetimes of the most         massive stars, the hardness of the ionising spectrum decreases         rapidly, leading to the disappearance of the characteristic He         Ii recombination lines after \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 3         Myr in instantaneous bursts; - He II lambda 1640,         H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} (and other) line luminosities usable as         indicators of the star formation rate are given for the case of         a constant SFR. For obvious reasons such indicators depend         strongly on the IMF; - due to an increased photon production and         reduced metal yields, the relative efficiency of ionising photon         energy to heavy element rest mass production, eta , of metal-         poor and metal-free populations is increased by factors of         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 4 to 18 with respect to solar         metallicity and for ``standard'' IMFs; - the lowest values of         eta \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1.6-2.2\% are obtained for         IMFs exclusively populated with high mass stars (M$_{low}$         \&gt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 50 M$_{sun}$). If correct,         the yields dominated by pair creation SNae then predict large         overabundances of O/C and Si/C compared to solar abundance         ratios. Detailed results are given in tabular form and as fit         formulae for easy implementation in other calculations. The         predicted spectra will be used to study the detectability of Pop         III galaxies and to derive optimal search strategies for such         objects.},

	abstract = {The solar chemical composition is an important ingredient in our         understanding of the formation, structure, and evolution of both         the Sun and our Solar System. Furthermore, it is an essential         reference standard against which the elemental contents of other         astronomical objects are compared. In this review, we evaluate         the current understanding of the solar photospheric composition.         In particular, we present a redetermination of the abundances of         nearly all available elements, using a realistic new three-         dimensional (3D), time-dependent hydrodynamical model of the         solar atmosphere. We have carefully considered the atomic input         data and selection of spectral lines, and accounted for         departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) whenever         possible. The end result is a comprehensive and homogeneous         compilation of the solar elemental abundances. Particularly         noteworthy findings are significantly lower abundances of C, N,         O, and Ne compared to the widely used values of a decade ago.         The new solar chemical composition is supported by a high degree         of internal consistency between available abundance indicators,         and by agreement with values obtained in the Solar Neighborhood         and from the most pristine meteorites. There is, however, a         stark conflict with standard models of the solar interior         according to helioseismology, a discrepancy that has yet to find         a satisfactory resolution.},

SKIRT         employs the Monte Carlo technique to emulate the relevant         physical processes including scattering, absorption and emission         by the dust. The code features a wealth of built-in geometries,         radiation source spectra, dust characterizations, dust grids,         and detectors, in addition to various mechanisms for importing         snapshots generated by hydrodynamical simulations. The         configuration for a particular simulation is defined at run-time         through a user-friendly interface suitable for both occasional         and power users. These capabilities are enabled by careful C++         code design. The programming interfaces between components are         well defined and narrow. Adding a new feature is usually as         simple as adding another class; the user interface automatically         adjusts to allow configuring the new options. We argue that many         scientific codes, like SKIRT, can benefit from careful object-         oriented design and from a friendly user interface, even if it         is not a graphical user interface.},

	abstract = {We present the escape fraction of hydrogen ionizing photons (f\_esc)         from a sample of 34 high-resolution cosmological zoom-in         simulations of galaxies at z\&gt;5 in the Feedback in Realistic         Environments project, post-processed with a Monte Carlo         radiative transfer code for ionizing radiation. Our sample         consists of 8500 halos in         M\_vir\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10\^8--10\^\{12\} M\_sun         (M\_star\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10\^4--10\^\{10\}         M\_sun) at z=5--12. We find the sample average \&lt;f\_esc\&gt;         increases with halo mass for         M\_vir\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10\^8--10\^\{9.5\} M\_sun,         becomes nearly constant for         M\_vir\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10\^\{9.5\}--10\^\{11\}         M\_sun, and decreases at M\_vir\&gt;10\^\{11\} M\_sun.         Equivalently, \&lt;f\_esc\&gt; increases with stellar mass up to         M\_star\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10\^8 M\_sun and         decreases at higher masses. Even applying single-star stellar         population synthesis models, we find a moderate         \&lt;f\_esc\&gt;\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.2 for galaxies         at M\_star\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10\^8 M\_sun. Nearly         half of the escaped ionizing photons come from stars 1--3 Myr         old and the rest from stars 3--10 Myr old. Binaries only have a         modest effect, boosting \&lt;f\_esc\&gt; by         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde25--35\% and the number of         escaped photons by 60--80\%. Most leaked ionizing photons are         from vigorously star-forming regions that usually contain a         feedback-driven kpc-scale superbubble surrounded by a dense         shell. The shell is forming stars while accelerated, so new         stars formed earlier in the shell are already inside the shell.         Young stars in the bubble and near the edge of the shell can         fully ionize some low-column-density paths pre-cleared by         feedback, allowing a large fraction of their ionizing photons to         escape. The decrease of \&lt;f\_esc\&gt; at the high-mass end is         due to dust attenuation, while at the low-mass end,         \&lt;f\_esc\&gt; decreases owing to inefficient star formation         (and hence feedback). At fixed mass, \&lt;f\_esc\&gt; tends to         increase with redshift. Our simulations produce sufficient         ionizing photons for cosmic reionization.},

	abstract = {We present a numerical and analytical study of the thermal fragmentation         of a turbulent flow of interstellar hydrogen. We first present         the different dynamical processes and the large range of spatial         (and temporal) scales that need to be adequately represented in         numerical simulations. Next, we present bidimensional         simulations of turbulent converging flows which induce the         dynamical condensation of the warm neutral phase into the cold         phase. We then analyse the cold structures and the fraction of         unstable gas in each simulation, paying particular attention to         the influence of the degree of turbulence. When the flow is very         turbulent a large fraction of the gas remains in the thermally         unstable domain. This unstable gas forms a filamentary network.         We show that the fraction of thermally unstable gas is strongly         correlated with the level of turbulence of the flow. We then         develop a semi-analytical model to explain the origin of this         unstable gas. This simple model is able to quantitatively         reproduce the fraction of unstable gas observed in the         simulations and its correlation with turbulence. Finally, we         stress the fact that even when the flow is very turbulent and in         spite of the fact that a large fraction of the gas is maintained         dynamically in the thermally unstable domain, the classical         picture of a 2-phase medium with stiff thermal fronts and local         pressure equilibrium turns out to be still relevant in the         vicinity of the cold structures.

	abstract = {Circumbinary discs are generally thought to take up angular momentum and         energy from the binary orbit over time through gravitational         torques mediated by orbital resonances. This process leads to         the shrinkage of the binary orbit over time, and is important in         a variety of astrophysical contexts including the orbital         evolution of stellar binaries, the migration of planets in         protoplanetary discs, and the evolution of black hole binaries         (stellar and supermassive). The merger of compact object         binaries provides a source of gravitational waves in the         Universe. Recently, several groups have reported numerical         simulations of circumbinary discs that yield the opposite         result, finding that the binary expands with time. Here we argue         that this result is primarily due to the choice of simulation         parameters, made for numerical reasons, which differ from         realistic disc parameters in many cases. We provide physical         arguments, and then demonstrate with 3D hydrodynamical         simulations, that thick (high pressure, high viscosity) discs         drive sufficient accretion of high angular momentum material to         force binary expansion, while in the more realistic case of thin         (low pressure, low viscosity) discs there is less accretion and         the binary shrinks. In the latter case, tides, which generally         transfer angular momentum and energy from the more rapidly         rotating object (the binary) to the less rapidly rotating object         (the disc), are the dominant driver of disc-binary evolution.         This causes the binary to shrink. We therefore conclude that for         common circumbinary disc parameters, binaries with non-extreme         mass ratios are expected to shrink over time. Expansion of the         binary can occur if the disc viscosity is unusually high, which         may occur in the very thick discs encountered in e.g.         circumplanetary discs, super-Eddington AGN, or the outer regions         of passive protostellar discs that are heated by the ...

@article{McKee2007,
	abstract = {We review current understanding of star formation, outlining an overall         theoretical framework and the observations that motivate it. A         conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence         plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate         gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the         effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical         processes involved in star formation{\textemdash}turbulence,         magnetic fields, and self-gravity{\textemdash}are highly         nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to         identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star         formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to         quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-         scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large         scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and         their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form         and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and         what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales         range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget.         We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including         ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is         increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing         angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding         questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a         comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by         the next generation of telescopes.},

	abstract = {We present the first comparative study of extragalactic Giant Molecular         Clouds (GMCs) using complete datasets for entire galaxies and a         uniform set of reduction and analysis techniques. We present         results based on CO observations for the Large Magellanic Cloud         (LMC), Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), M33, M31, IC 10, and the         nucleus of M64, and make comparisons with archival Milky Way         observations. Our sample includes large spirals and dwarf         irregulars with metallicities that vary by an order of         magnitude. GMCs in HI-rich galaxies are seen to be well-         correlated with Hi filaments that pervade the galactic disks,         suggesting that they form from preexisting Hi structures. Virial         estimates of the ratio of CO line strength to H2 column density,         XCO, suggest that a value of 4 {\texttimes} 1020 cm-2 (K km         s-1)-1 is a good value to use in most galaxies (except the SMC)         if the GMCs are virialized. However, if the clouds are only         marginally self-gravitating, as appears to be the case judging         from their appearance, half the virial value may be more         appropriate. There is no clear trend of XCO with metallicity.         The clouds within a galaxy are shown to have the about the same         H2 surface density, and differences between galaxies seem to be         no more than a factor of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2. We         show that hydrostatic pressure appears to be the main factor in         determining what fraction of atomic gas is turned into         molecules. In the high-pressure regions often found in galactic         centers, the observed properties of GMCs appear to be different         from those in the found in the Local Group. From the association         of tracers of star formation with GMCs in the LMC, we find that         about one-fourth of the GMCs exhibit no evidence of star         formation, and we estimate that the lifetime of a typical GMC in         these galaxies is 20-30 m.y. \textbackslash\textbackslash},

	abstract = {The paper evaluates the efficiency with which O stars disperse the         molecular clouds from which they form. An O star near the         surface of an extended molecular cloud ionizes a H II region         which is radiation-bounded on the inner side (towards the cloud         center) and density-bounded on the outer side; consequently the         ionized gas can stream away into space on the outer side, and         this in turn enables the ionization front on the inner side to         advance faster into the cloud, thus eroding a large cavity         around the O star. This process may be very effective in         destroying molecular clouds; if approximately 4 per cent of a         cloud's material were converted into new stars with a Salpeter         Initial Mass Function, the remaining 96 per cent could be broken         up and dispersed by the ionizing radiation from the O stars.},

From these         data input parameters to magnetic star formation theory are         calculated, and predictions of theory are compared with         observations. Results for this cloud sample are the following:         (1) Internal motions are supersonic but approximately equal to         the Alfv{\'e}n speed, which suggests that supersonic motions are         likely MHD waves. (2) The ratio of thermal to magnetic pressures         {\ensuremath{\beta}}$_{p}$\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.04,         implying that magnetic fields are important in the physics of         molecular clouds. (3) The mass-to-magnetic flux ratio is about         twice critical, which suggests but does not require that static         magnetic fields alone are insufficient to support clouds against         gravity. (4) Kinetic and magnetic energies are approximately         equal, which suggests that static magnetic fields and MHD waves         are roughly equally important in cloud energetics. (5) Magnetic         field strengths scale with gas densities as |B|\raisebox{-0.5ex}         \textasciitilde{\ensuremath{\rho}}$^{{\ensuremath{\kappa}}}$         with {\ensuremath{\kappa}}\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.47         this agrees with the prediction of ambipolar diffusion driven         star formation, but this scaling may also be predicted simply by         Alfv{\'e}nic motions. The measurements of magnetic field         strengths in molecular clouds make it clear that magnetic fields         are a crucial component of the physics governing cloud evolution         and star formation.},

@article{Koelligan2018,
	abstract = {Context. Massive stars live short but intense lives. While less numerous         than low-mass stars, they enormously impact their surroundings         by several feedback mechanisms. They form in opaque and far-away         regions of the galaxy, such that one of these feedback         mechanisms also becomes a record of their evolution: their         bright large-scale jets and outflows.  Aims: In a         comprehensive convergence study, we investigate the         computational conditions necessary to resolve (pseudo-) disk         formation and jet-launching processes, and analyze possible         caveats. We explore the magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) processes of         the collapse of massive prestellar cores in detail, including an         analysis of the forces involved and their temporal evolution for         up to two free-fall times.  Methods: We conduct         MHD simulations using the state-of-the-art code PLUTO, combining         nonideal MHD, self-gravity, and very high resolutions as they         have never been achieved before. Our setup includes a 100         M$_{☉}$ cloud core that collapses under its own self-gravity to         self-consistently form a dense disk structure and launch tightly         collimated magneto-centrifugal jets and wide-angle tower flows.          Results: We show a comprehensive evolutionary         picture of the collapse of a massive prestellar core with a         detailed analysis of the physical processes involved and our         high-resolution simulations can resolve a magneto-centrifugal         jet and a magnetic pressure-driven outflow, separately. The         nature of the outflows depends critically on spatial resolution.         Only high-resolution simulations are able to differentiate a         magneto-centrifugally launched, highly collimated jet from a         slow wide-angle magnetic-pressure-driven tower flow. Of these         two outflow components, the tower flow dominates angular-         momentum transport. The mass outflow rate is dominated by the         entrained material from the interaction of the jet with the         stellar environment and only part of the ejected medium is         directly launched from the accretion disk. A tower flow can only         develop to its full extent when much of the original envelope         has already dispersed. Taking into account both the mass         launched from the surface of the disk and the entrained material         from the envelope, we find an ejection-to-accretion efficiency         of 10\%. Nonideal MHD is required to form centrifugally         supported accretion disks and the disk size is strongly         dependent on spatial resolution. A converged result for disk and         both outflow components requires a spatial resolution of         {\ensuremath{\Delta}}x {\ensuremath{\leq}} 0.17 au at 1 au and         sink-cell sizes {\ensuremath{\leq}}3.1 au.          Conclusions: Massive stars not only possess slow wide-angle         tower flows, but also produce magneto-centrifugal jets, just as         their low-mass counterparts. The actual difference between low-         mass and high-mass star formation lies in the ``embeddedness''         of the high-mass star which implies that the jet and tower flow         interact with the infalling large-scale stellar environment,         potentially resulting in entrainment.},

Our         region is evolved for 10 Myr and shows clustered star formation         along the arm generating ≍ 5000 cluster sink particles ≍ 5 per         cent of which contain at least one of the ≍ 4000 stars of mass         $\gt$18 M$_{☉}$. Photoionization has a noticeable effect on the         gas in the region, producing ionized cavities and leading to         dense features at the edge of the H II regions. Compared to the         no-feedback case, photoionization produces a larger total mass         of clouds and clumps, with around twice as many such objects,         which are individually smaller and more broken up. After this we         see a rapid decrease in the total mass in clouds and the number         of clouds. Unlike studies of isolated clouds, our simulations         follow the long-range effects of ionization, with some already         dense gas, becoming compressed from multiple sides by         neighbouring H II regions. This causes star formation that is         both accelerated and partially displaced throughout the spiral         arm with up to 30 per cent of our cluster sink particle mass         forming at distances $\gt$5 pc from sites of sink formation in         the absence of feedback. At later times, the star formation rate         decreases to below that of the no-feedback case.},

	abstract = {We investigate the formation and fragmentation of discs using a suite of         3D smoothed particle radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations.         Our models are initialized as 1 M$_{☉}$ rotating Bonnor-Ebert         spheres that are threaded with a uniform magnetic field. We         examine the effect of including ideal and non-ideal magnetic         fields, the orientation and strength of the magnetic field, and         the initial rotational rate. We follow the gravitational         collapse and early evolution of each system until the final         classification of the protostellar disc can be determined. Of         our 105 models, 41 fragment, 21 form a spiral structure but do         not fragment, and another 12 form smooth discs. Fragmentation is         more likely to occur for faster initial rotation rates and         weaker magnetic fields. For stronger magnetic field strengths,         the inclusion of non-ideal MHD promotes disc formation, and         several of these models fragment, whereas their ideal MHD         counterparts do not. For the models that fragment, there is no         correlation between our parameters and where or when the         fragmentation occurs. Bipolar outflows are launched in only 17         models, and these models have strong magnetic fields that are         initially parallel to the rotation axis. Counter-rotating         envelopes form in four slowly rotating, strong-field models -         including one ideal MHD model - indicating they form only in a         small fraction of the parameter space investigated.},

	abstract = {We investigate the formation and early evolution and fragmentation of an         accretion disk around a forming massive protostar. We use a         grid-based self-gravity-radiation-hydrodynamics code including a         sub-grid module for stellar and dust evolution. On purpose, we         do not use sink particles to allow for all paths of fragment         formation and destruction, but instead keeping the spatial grid         resolution high enough to properly resolve the physical length         scales of the problem. We use a 3D grid in spherical coordinates         with a logarithmic scaling in the radial direction and cosine         scaling in the polar direction. Because of that, roughly 25\% of         the total number of grid cells, corresponding to $\sim$ 26         million grid cells, are used to model the disk physics. They         constitute the highest resolution simulations performed up to         now on disk fragmentation around a forming massive star with the         physics considered here. We study the convergence of our results         by performing the same simulation for 5 different resolutions.         We start from the collapse of a molecular cloud; a massive         (proto)star is formed in its center, surrounded by a fragmenting         Keplerian-like accretion disk with spiral arms. The fragments         have masses of $\sim 1 M_\odot$, and their continuous         interactions with the disk, spiral arms and other fragments         results in eccentric orbits. Fragments form hydrostatic cores,         surrounded by secondary disks with spiral arms that also produce         new fragments. We identified several mechanisms of fragment         formation, interaction and destruction. Central temperatures of         the fragments can reach the hydrogen dissociation limit, form         second Larson cores and evolve into companion stars. Based on         this, we study the multiplicity predicted by the simulations and         find $\sim 6$ companions at different distances from the         primary: from possible spectroscopic multiples, to companions at         distances between 1000 and 2000 au.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive investigation of main-sequence (MS) binaries         in the DRAGON simulations, which are the first one-million         particles direct $N$-body simulations of globular clusters. We         analyse the orbital parameters of the binary samples in two of         the DRAGON simulations, D1-R7- IMF93 and D2-R7-IMF01, focusing         on their secular evolution and correlations up to 12 Gyr. These         two models have different initial stellar mass functions: Kroupa         1993 (D1-R7-IMF93) and Kroupa 2001 (D2-R7-IMF01); and different         initial mass ratio distributions: random paring (D1-R7-IMF93)         and a power-law (D1-R7-IMF93). In general, the mass ratio of a         population of binaries increases over time due to stellar         evolution, which is less significant in D2-R7-IMF01. In         D1-R7-IMF93, primordial binaries with mass ratio $q \approx$ 0.2         are most common, and the frequency linearly declines with         increasing $q$ at all times. Dynamical binaries of both models         have higher eccentricities and larger semi-major axes than         primordial binaries. They are preferentially located in the         inner part of the star cluster. Secular evolution of binary         orbital parameters does not depend on the initial mass-ratio         distribution, but is sensitive to the initial binary         distribution of the system. At t = 12 Gyr, the binary fraction         decreases radially outwards, and mass segregation is present. A         color difference of 0.1 mag in $F330W-F814W$ and 0.2 mag in         $NUV-y$ between the core and the outskirts of both clusters is         seen, which is a reflection of the binary radial distribution         and the mass segregation in the cluster. The complete set of         data for primordial and dynamical binary systems at all snapshot         intervals is made publicly available.},

	abstract = {{We investigate the dependence of stellar properties on the mean thermal Jeans mass in molecular clouds. We compare the results from the two largest hydrodynamical simulations of star formation to resolve the fragmentation process down to the opacity limit, the first of which was reported by Bate, Bonnell \\&amp; Bromm. The initial conditions of the two calculations are identical except for the radii of the clouds, which are chosen so that the mean densities and mean thermal Jeans masses of the clouds differ by factors of 9 and 3, respectively.We find that the denser cloud, with the lower mean thermal Jeans mass, produces a higher proportion of brown dwarfs and has a lower characteristic (median) mass of the stars and brown dwarfs. This dependence of the initial mass function (IMF) on the density of the cloud may explain the observation that the Taurus star-forming region appears to be deficient in brown dwarfs when compared with the Orion Trapezium cluster. The new calculation also produces wide binaries (separations \\&gt;20 au), one of which is a wide binary brown dwarf system.Based on the hydrodynamical calculations, we develop a simple accretion/ejection model for the origin of the IMF. In the model, all stars and brown dwarfs begin with the same mass (set by the opacity limit for fragmentation) and grow in mass until their accretion is terminated stochastically by their ejection from the cloud through dynamically interactions. The model predicts that the main variation of the IMF in different star-forming environments should be in the location of the peak (due to variations in the mean thermal Jeans mass of the cloud) and in the substellar regime. However, the slope of the IMF at high masses may depend on the dispersion in the accretion rates of protostars.}},

	abstract = {{We investigate how the dynamical state of a turbulently supported, 1000 M⊙, molecular cloud affects the properties of the cluster it forms, focusing our discussion on the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the initial mass function (IMF). A variety of initial energy states are examined in this paper, ranging from clouds with |Egrav| = 0.1 Ekin to clouds with |Egrav| = 10 Ekin, and for both isothermal and piece-wise polytropic equations of state (similar to that suggested by Larson). It is found that arbitrary SFEs are possible, with strongly unbound clouds yielding very low SFEs. We suggest that the low SFE in the Maddelena cloud may be a consequence of the relatively unbound state of its internal structure. It is also found that competitive accretion results in the observed IMF when the clouds have initial energy states of |Egrav| ≥Ekin. We show that under such conditions the shape of the IMF is independent of time in the calculations. This demonstrates that the global accretion process can be terminated at any stage in the cluster's evolution, while still yielding a distribution of stellar masses that is consistent with the observed IMF. As the clouds become progressively more unbound, competitive accretion is less important and the protostellar mass function flattens. These results predict that molecular clouds should be permeated with a distributed population of stars that follow a flatter than Salpeter IMF.}},

	annote = {Molecular clouds are observed to be turbulent, but the origin of this turbulence is not well understood. As a result, there are two different approaches to simulating molecular clouds, one in which the turbulence is allowed to decay after it is initialized, and one in which it is driven. We use the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code, Orion, to perform high-resolution simulations of molecular cloud cores and protostars in environments with both driven and decaying turbulence. We include self-gravity, use a barotropic equation of state, and represent regions exceeding the maximum grid resolution with sink particles. We analyze the properties of bound cores such as size, shape, line width, and rotational energy, and we find reasonable agreement with observation. At high resolution the different rates of core accretion in the two cases have a significant effect on protostellar system development. Clumps forming in a decaying turbulence environment produce high-multiplicity protostellar systems with Toomre Q unstable disks that exhibit characteristics of the competitive accretion model for star formation. In contrast, cores forming in the context of continuously driven turbulence and virial equilibrium form smaller protostellar systems with fewer low-mass members. Our simulations of driven and decaying turbulence show some statistically significant differences, particularly in the production of brown dwarfs and core rotation, but the uncertainties are large enough that we are not able to conclude whether observations favor one or the other.},

	abstract = {We present a set of 3-dimensional, radiation-magnetohydrodynamic calculations of the gravitational collapse of massive (300 Msun), star-forming molecular cloud cores. We show that the combined effects of magnetic fields and radiative feedback strongly suppress core fragmentation, leading to the production of single star systems rather than small clusters. We find that the two processes are efficient at suppressing fragmentation in different regimes, with the feedback most effective in the dense, central region and the magnetic field most effective in more diffuse, outer regions. Thus, the combination of the two is much more effective at suppressing fragmentation than either one considered in isolation. Our work suggests that typical massive cores, which have mass-to-flux ratios of about 2 relative to critical, likely form a single star system, but that cores with weaker fields may form a small star cluster. This result helps us understand why the observed relationship between the core mass function and the stellar initial mass function holds even for {\~{}}100 Msun cores with many thermal Jeans masses of material. We also demonstrate that a {\~{}}40 AU Keplerian disk is able to form in our simulations, despite the braking effect caused by the strong magnetic field.},

	abstract = {As star-forming clouds collapse, the gas within them fragments to ever-smaller masses. Naively one might expect this process to continue down to the smallest mass that is able to radiate away its binding energy on a dynamical timescale, the opacity limit for fragmentation, at {\$}\backslashsim 0.01{\$} {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. However, the observed peak of the initial mass function (IMF) lies a factor of {\$}20-30{\$} higher in mass, suggesting that some other mechanism halts fragmentation before the opacity limit is reached. In this paper we analyse radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of star cluster formation in typical Milky Way environments in order to determine what physical process limits fragmentation in them. We examine the regions in the vicinity of stars that form in the simulations to determine the amounts of mass that are prevented from fragmenting by thermal and magnetic pressure. We show that, on small scales, thermal pressure enhanced by stellar radiation heating is the dominant mechanism limiting the ability of the gas to further fragment. In the brown dwarf mass regime, {\$}\backslashsim 0.01{\$} {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, the typical object that forms in the simulations is surrounded by gas whose mass is several times its own that is unable to escape or fragment, and instead is likely to accrete. This mechanism explains why {\$}\backslashsim 0.01{\$} {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} objects are rare: unless an outside agent intervenes (e.g., a shock strips away the gas around them), they will grow by accreting the warmed gas around them. In contrast, by the time stars grow to masses of {\$}\backslashsim 0.2{\$} {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, the mass of heated gas is only tens of percent of the central star mass, too small to alter its final mass by a large factor. This naturally explains why the IMF peak is at {\$}\backslashsim 0.2{\$} {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}.},

	abstract = {Early star-forming galaxies produced copious ionizing photons. A         fraction of these photons escaped gas within galaxies to         reionize the entire Universe. This escape fraction is crucial         for determining how the Universe became reionized, but the         neutral intergalactic medium precludes direct measurement of the         escape fraction at high redshifts. Indirect estimates of the         escape fraction must describe how the Universe was reionized.         Here, we present new Keck Cosmic Web Imager spatially resolved         spectroscopy of the resonant Mg II 2800 {\r{A}} doublet from a         redshift 0.36 galaxy, J1503+3644, with a previously observed         escape fraction of 6 per cent. The Mg II emission has a similar         spatial extent as the stellar continuum, and each of the Mg II         doublet lines are well fitted by single Gaussians. The Mg II is         optically thin. The intrinsic flux ratio of the red and blue Mg         II emission line doublet, $R=F_{2796}/F_{2803}$ , is set by         atomic physics to be two, but Mg $^+$ gas along the line of         sight decreases R proportional to the Mg II optical depth.         Combined with the metallicity, R estimates the neutral gas         column density. The observed R ranges across the galaxy from 0.8         to 2.7, implying a factor of 2 spatial variation of the relative         escape fraction. All of the ionizing photons that escape         J1503+3644 pass through regions of high R. We combine the Mg II         emission and dust attenuation to accurately estimate the         absolute escape fractions for 10 local Lyman Continuum emitting         galaxies and suggest that Mg II can predict escape fraction         within the epoch of reionization.},

	abstract = {Following our first detection reported in Izotov et al., we present the         detection of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation of four other         compact star-forming galaxies observed with the Cosmic Origins         Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. These         galaxies, at redshifts of z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.3, are         characterized by high emission-line flux ratios [O III]         {\ensuremath{\lambda}}5007/[O II] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}3727         {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 5. The escape fractions of the LyC         radiation f$_{esc}$(LyC) in these galaxies are in the range of         {\ensuremath{\sim}}6-13 per cent, the highest values found so         far in low-redshift star-forming galaxies. Narrow double-peaked         Ly {\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission lines are detected in the         spectra of all four galaxies, compatible with predictions for         LyC leakers. We find escape fractions of Ly         {\ensuremath{\alpha}}, f$_{esc}$(Ly {\ensuremath{\alpha}})         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 20-40 per cent, among the highest known for         Ly {\ensuremath{\alpha}} emitting galaxies. Surface brightness         profiles produced from the COS acquisition images reveal bright         star-forming regions in the centre and exponential discs in the         outskirts with disc scalelengths {\ensuremath{\alpha}} in the         range {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.6-1.4 kpc. Our galaxies are         characterized by low metallicity, {\ensuremath{\sim}}1/8-1/5         solar, low stellar mass {\ensuremath{\sim}}(0.2-4) {\texttimes}         {}10$^{9}$ M$_{☉}$, high star formation rates, SFR         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 14-36 M$_{☉}$ yr$^{-1}$, and high SFR         densities, {\ensuremath{\Sigma}} {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2-35         M$_{☉}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. These properties are comparable to         those of high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Finally, our         observations, combined with our first detection reported in         Izotov et al., reveal that a selection for compact star-forming         galaxies showing high [O III] {\ensuremath{\lambda}}5007/[O II]         {\ensuremath{\lambda}}3727 ratios appears to pick up very         efficiently sources with escaping LyC radiation: all five of our         selected galaxies are LyC leakers.},

	abstract = {One of the key questions in observational cosmology is the         identification of the sources responsible for ionization of the         Universe after the cosmic {\textquoteleft}Dark         Ages{\textquoteright}, when the baryonic matter was neutral. The         currently identified distant galaxies are insufficient to fully         reionize the Universe by redshift         z{\,}{\ensuremath{\approx}}{\,}6 (refs 1, 2, 3), but low-mass,         star-forming galaxies are thought to be responsible for the bulk         of the ionizing radiation. As direct observations at high         redshift are difficult for a variety of reasons, one solution is         to identify local proxies of this galaxy population. Starburst         galaxies at low redshifts, however, generally are opaque to         Lyman continuum photons. Small escape fractions of about 1 to 3         per cent, insufficient to ionize much surrounding gas, have been         detected only in three low-redshift galaxies. Here we report         far-ultraviolet observations of the nearby low-mass star-forming         galaxy J0925+1403. The galaxy is leaking ionizing radiation with         an escape fraction of about 8 per cent. The total number of         photons emitted during the starburst phase is sufficient to         ionize intergalactic medium material that is about 40 times as         massive as the stellar mass of the galaxy.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate a new method for measuring the escape fraction of         ionizing photons using Hubble Space Telescope imaging of         resolved stars in NGC 4214, a local analog of high-redshift         starburst galaxies that are thought to be responsible for cosmic         reionization. Specifically, we forward model the UV through         near-IR spectral energy distributions of         {\ensuremath{\sim}}83,000 resolved stars to infer their         individual ionizing flux outputs. We constrain the local escape         fraction by comparing the number of ionizing photons produced by         stars to the number that are either absorbed by dust or consumed         by ionizing the surrounding neutral hydrogen in individual star-         forming regions. We find substantial spatial variation in the         escape fraction (0\%-40\%). Integrating over the entire galaxy         yields a global escape fraction of ${25}_{-15}^{+16}$ \%. This         value is much higher than previous escape fractions of zero         reported for this galaxy. We discuss the sources of this         apparent tension and demonstrate that the viewing angle and 3D         interstellar medium geometric effects are the cause. If we         assume that NGC 4214 has no internal dust, like many high-         redshift galaxies, we find an escape fraction of 59\% (an upper         limit for NGC 4214). This is the first nonzero escape fraction         measurement for UV-faint (M ${}_{\mathrm{FUV}}$ = -15.9)         galaxies at any redshift and supports the idea that starburst         UV-faint dwarf galaxies can provide a sufficient number of         ionizing photons to the intergalactic medium.},

	abstract = {A new N-body and hydrodynamical code, called RAMSES, is presented. It         has been designed to study structure formation in the universe         with high spatial resolution. The code is based on Adaptive Mesh         Refinement (AMR) technique, with a tree-based data structure         allowing recursive grid refinements on a cell-by-cell basis. The         N-body solver is very similar to the one developed for the ART         code citep\{kravtsov97\}, with minor differences         in the exact implementation. The hydrodynamical solver is based         on a second-order Godunov method, a modern shock-capturing         scheme known to compute accurately the thermal history of the         fluid component. The accuracy of the code is carefully estimated         using various test cases, from pure gas dynamical tests to         cosmological ones. The specific refinement strategy used in         cosmological simulations is described, and potential spurious         effects associated with shock waves propagation in the resulting         AMR grid are discussed and found to be negligible. Results         obtained in a large N-body and hydrodynamical simulation of         structure formation in a low density Lambda CDM universe are         reported, with {}256$^{3}$ particles and 4.1x {}10$^{7}$ cells         in the AMR grid, reaching a formal resolution of {}8192$^{3}$. A         convergence analysis of different quantities, such as dark         matter density power spectrum, gas pressure power spectrum and         individual haloe temperature profiles, shows that numerical         results are converging down to the actual resolution limit of         the code, and are well reproduced by recent analytical         predictions in the framework of the halo model.},

	abstract = {We present the first three-dimensional radiation-magnetohydrodynamic         simulations of the photoionization of a dense, magnetized         molecular globule by an external source of ultraviolet         radiation. We find that, for the case of a strong ionizing         field, significant deviations from the non-magnetic evolution         are seen when the initial magnetic field threading the globule         has an associated magnetic pressure that is greater than 100         times the gas pressure. In such a strong-field case, the         photoevaporating globule will adopt a flattened or `curled up'         shape, depending on the initial field orientation, and magnetic         confinement of the ionized photoevaporation flow can lead to         recombination and subsequent fragmentation during advanced         stages of the globule evolution. We find suggestive evidence         that such magnetic effects may be important in the formation of         bright, bar-like emission features in HII regions. We include         simple but realistic fits to heating and cooling rates in the         neutral and molecular gas in the vicinity of a high-mass star         cluster, and show that the frequently used isothermal         approximation can lead to an overestimate of the importance of         gravitational instability in the radiatively imploded globule.         For globules within 2 pc of a high-mass star cluster, we find         that heating by stellar X-rays prevents the molecular gas from         cooling below 50 K.

@book{Leckrone2020,
	abstract = {The Hubble Space Telescope is one of the most important scientific and engineering endeavors of our time. It has given humankind the first truly clear view of the heavens and has revolutionized almost every area of modern astronomy. The author this text, David Leckrone, worked as a project scientist on Hubble for 33 years. From 1992--2009 he was the Senior Project Scientist for Hubble at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. In that role he had an insider's view of the trials and triumphs of the Hubble mission, including its extraordinary scientific discoveries and the personal journeys of the astronomers who made them, the adventure of five successful shuttle-based servicing missions, and the quiet heroism of the many scientists, engineers and managers who rose to the occasion when Hubble was in trouble. This book is loosely a personal memoir but can more accurately be called a ``Hubble family memoir'' for which Leckrone serves as narrator.Based on numerous interviews and personal observations, Life With Hubble tells the human stories and describes the professional achievements of scores of talented and dedicated individuals who made major contributions to the Hubble legacy. It spans the years from 1990, when Hubble was launched and when the affliction of spherical aberration was discovered in its optics, through the final servicing mission in 2009 and up to the present day. There are also numerous flashbacks from earlier years. This book is aimed at an informed, non-professional audience, including those who have followed the saga of Hubble throughout its lifetime.},

In this book the authors outline the fundamentals for computational astrophysics, focusing on the use of the Astronomical Multipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE), which is a general-purpose simulation environment in astrophysics written in Python. AMUSE allows you to combine existing solvers to build new applications that can be combined again to study gradually more complex situations. This enables the growth of multi-physics and multi-scale application software in a hierarchical fashion, testing each intermediate step as the complexity of the software continues to increase. All examples in the book are associated with codes that run on a simple laptop or workstation. All figures are reproducible with a simple script, and all scripts are available online to be downloaded and run accordingly.},

It describes the structure and evolution of stars, with emphasis on the basic physical principles and the interplay between the different processes inside stars such as nuclear reactions, energy transport, chemical mixing, pulsation, mass loss, and rotation. Based on these principles, the evolution of low- and high-mass stars is explained from their formation to their death. In addition to homework exercises for each chapter, the text contains a large number of questions that are meant to stimulate the understanding of the physical principles. An extensive set of accompanying lecture slides is available for teachers in both Keynote{\textregistered} and PowerPoint{\textregistered} formats.},

The structure of the book is as follows. The first two chapters begin with a discussion of observational techniques, and the basic phenomenology they reveal. The goal is to familiarize students with the basic techniques that will be used throughout, and to provide a common vocabulary for the rest of the book. The next five chapters provide a similar review of the basic physical processes that are important for star formation. Again, the goal is to provide a basis for what follows. The remaining chapters discuss star formation over a variety of scales, starting with the galactic scale and working down to the scales of individual stars and their disks. The book concludes with a brief discussion of the clearing of disks and the transition to planet formation. The book includes five problem sets, complete with solutions.},
