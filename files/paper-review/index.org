* Star Formation
** Star formation
*** Star formation: general
**** Krumholz:2011a, Star Formation in Molecular Clouds

- Star-forming clouds are generally cold, most of observational
  techniques require on infrared, sub-millimeter, and radio observations
- H2

  - In the high densities where stars form, H tends to be molecular, and
    H2 is extremely hard to observe. (H atoms is easy to observe via 21
    cm hyperfine line)

    - The first excited state is the J = 1 rotational state, is above
      100 K, but dense ISM has T ~ 10 K. Also, because H2 is a
      homonuclear molecule and have zero electric dipole moment, meaning
      there is no J = 1 -> 0 emission.

  - Observing the dust

    - Dust grains emit thermal radiation. They can absorb or emit
      continuum radiation.

*** Star formation: theories
**** Padoan1997

- One of the first models combining the effects of density fluctuations
  and gravity to predict a CMF.
- Assuming a lognormal density PDF and isothermal gas. Estimate the
  number of regions in which the density would be sufficiently high so
  that the Jeans mass is below a value.
- Predicts a lognormal CMF with a peak and a power-law extension at high
  masses
- Limitations:

  1. neglected local turbulent support
  2. neglected size scale dependence of the gravitational instability

**** Padoan2002

- Heuristic assumption that the size of each region followed the
  characteristic size scale of postshock gas.
- More naturally led to a power-law high-mass slope

**** Hennebelle2008

- Assumed gas log density is a Gaussian random field.
- Density power spectrum gives the density distribution at all scales,
  resolving the size limitation in padoan:1997
- Turbulent + thermal support --> self-gravitating regions --> CMF with
  a peak, a Salpeter-like power law at high masses.
- One solution for the 'cloud-in-cloud' problem (Bond et al., 1991).
- Including:

  - Turbulent fragmentation

- Missing:

  - Gravitationally induced fragmentation

- Result: agree well with mass spectrum of observed CO clumps, less with
  the IMF-like CMF.

5. OVERVIEW OF THE STAR-FORMATION PROCESS

**** [[file:~/Googledrive/Academic/Papers/O/Offner2014.pdf][Offner2014]]:
The Origin and Universality of the Stellar Initial Mass Function

1. (Sec 2) Observations of IMF

   - Methods of deriving the IMF: 1. Measure the LF of a complete sample
     of stars. 2. the LF is converted into a present-day mass function
     (PDMF). 3. The PDMF is corrected for the star-formation history,
     stellar evolution, cluster evolution, and binarity to obtain the
     individual star IMF.
   - The Milky Ways have shown an near-universal IMF, expect the young
     nuclear cluster in the Galactic center where the MF is flatter than
     Salpeter.
   - There is no strong evidence for IMF variations within local
     galaxies.
   - Extragalactic determinations of the IMF dynamically compared
     mass-to-light retios to expectations of SPS models, or use spectral
     features to determine the relative numbers of low-mass stars. While
     elliptical galaxies show intriguing evidence for systematic IMF
     variations, further study is required to confirm.

2. (Sec 3.1) Observations of CMF

   - Observational methods and conclusions:

     1. Millimeter continuum dust emission in nearby molecular clouds.

        - The mass spectrum was reminiscent of the Salpeter IMF slope.
          The observed cores were the reservoirs that contribute most of
          the eventual stellar masses.

     2. Near-infrared extinction maps, which complements the dust
        emission measurements.

        - The mass spectrum has a shape similar to the Chabrier but is
          shifted toward larger masses by a factor of ~3.

     3. Herschel data (most recent up to 2014)

        - High-mass slope comparable to Salpeter with a peak located at
          ~1 solar mass.

   - Similarity between the shapes of the CMF and the IMF at large
     masses is reinforced.

3. (Sec 3.2) Analytical theories for the CMF

   See this section: [[*Star formation: theories][Star formation: theories]]

4. (Sec 3.3) The CMF from numerical simulations

   - Padoan et al. (2007): only thermal support, spectrum too steep. Magnetic pressure support included, spectrum close to Salpeter exponent.
   - Schmidt et al. (2010): turbulent support is necessary maintain a Salpeter slope. Turbulent forcing (*?*): more compression on gas, smaller collapsing regions.
   - Smith el al. (2009): both turbulence and self-gravity. define CMF as prestellar cores on the basis of either gravitational potential or thermal and turbulent support; define IMF as sink masses. Conclusion: both CMF and SMF resembled the observed IMF.

5. (Sec 4) The link b/t the CMF and the IMF

   Conditions for the shape of the IMF to derive directly from CMF:

   1. All cores are destined to condense into stars
   2. A universal core-to-star ratio
   3. Core fragmentation must be self-similar
   4. Cores condense at the same rate (??? depending on the timescale.

6. [TODO]{.todo .TODO} (Sec 4.1) Prestellar cores

   - State "TODO" from [2020-03-24 Tue 16:48]

   How do prestellar cores fragment?

   - *Thermal support* :: A fundamental quantity: the ratio of the core mass to Jeans mass, \(M_{\rm core} / M_{\rm Jeans}\), which depends on the monochromatic flux from the core, its distance, the dust temperature, the monochromatic mass-opacity (due to dust), and the mean gas-particle mass.

   - *Non-thermal support* :: - /Kinematics/Internal velocity/ - /Magnetic support/ Crutcher et al. (2009) suggest that magnetic fields are not able to support prestellar cores against gravity. TODO: check in my sims - /Cores from column density maps/ Although different methods of clump finding results in similar CMFs, the existence of the cores should be viewed with caution, particularly at low masses.

7. (Sec 4.2) Core fragmentation

   - The first unstable cores in these simulations are always around the
     mean thermal Jeans mass, 1 Msol.
   - Formation of massive disks:

     - Important channel for forming brown dwarfs and very-low-mass H-burning stars (Bate et al., 2002)
     - Magnetic torques may efficiently remove angular momentum, preventing from forming massive disks.
     - Radiative feedback from the central star. Radiative heating of high accretion luminosity stabilizes the disk against fragmentation. If accretion is episodic, disk fragmentation can still occur. (Stamatellos:2012)

8. High-mass Cores and IMF

   - Observed CMF only extends to ~10 Msol ???
   - This should extend to higher masses (Oey, 2011, McKee and Tan, 2002)
   - Open questions: efficiency with which core gas forms stars (core fragmentation).

     - Idealized geometry: observation, CMF peak at 1 Msol, suggesting e=30% ???

**** Heath2020: On the orbital evolution of binaries with circumbinary
discs

"We provide physical arguments, and then demonstrate with 3D hydrodynamical simulations, that thick (high pressure, high viscosity) discs drive sufficient accretion of high angular momentum material to force binary expansion, while in the more realistic case of thin (low pressure, low viscosity) discs there is less accretion and the binary shrinks."

*** Review: simulations of SF

Star formation is explored via hydrodynamic simulations in the literature (cite:Kim2018). 

*UV radiation feedback*
- cite:He2019,He2020. 
- cite:Fukushima2020a. In low-metallicity cases, the whole cloud is disrupted more easily by expanding H II bubbles that have higher temperature owing to less efficient cooling. The SFE drops by a factor of ~3 at 10^{-2} Z_{sun} compared to 1 Z_{sun}, regardless of $\Sigma$. They also provide a semi-analytical model of dependencies of the SFEs on the cloud $\Sigma$ and $Z$. 

*Compare various types of feedback*
cite:Kim2018 finds that radiation pressure becomes significant at 200-800 M_sun pc-2. The volume-integrated radiation pressure force in the radial direction tends to be smaller than that of gas pressure force in the early phase of star formation. This is due to the strong cancellation of radiation on a global scale.

Simple spherical models show that at surface density higher than 100 M_sun pc-2, radiation pressure becomes significant (compare to UV radiation feedback) (citep:Krumholz2009,Fall2010,Kim2016). 

Quick reviews:
- cite:Kim2018: A large grid of simulations with masses 10^{4-6}, tff ~ 0.5 - 20 Myr, or number density from 5 to 5000 cm-3. . 

*Protostellar feedback*
cite:Fukushima2020 shows that the critical physical process that sets the final mass of protostars is the formation and expansion of a bipolar H II region. With decreasing metallicity, the radiation-pressure effect becomes weaker, but photoionization heating of the circumstellar gas is more efficient owing to the reduced dust attenuation.

Magnetic properties

- B-rho relations:

  - Myers2021: Method: 17 dense cores within a few hundred parsecs of the Sun. Plane-of-the-sky field strengths. Conclusion: mass-to-flux ratio is 0.5 - 3 times the critical. \(B \propto n^{0.66}\). Matches with those derived from Zeeman studies (Crutcher2010). Could be explained by a sample of strongly bound, nearly magnetically critical cores with spheroidal shape.
  - The discussion section of Myers2021 has summarized a lot of researches, both with observations and simulations, of the B-rho relation. [[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.452.2500L][Li2015]] has the most complete comparison between simulations and observables: clumps has mildly supercritical mass-to-flux ratio.
  - Li2015: Mouschovias (1991) suggests that \(B \propto \bar{\rho}^{1/2} \sigma\), and Basu (2000) showed that this is in excellent agreement with observation.
  - In simulations, we could compare the line-of-sight mass-to-flux ratio, \(\mu_{\rm los}\). Figure out how \(\mu\) is actually measure.

Results from ALMA observations of Substructures in the Keplerian disc around the O-type (proto-)star G17.64+0.16 shows that the mass at center is 45+-10 Msun, disk mass is 0.6 - 2.6 Msun, and the disc currently appears stable for temperatures > 150 K.

*** Topics

**** Fragmentation of prestellar cores

*Goodwin2017*

In classical literature, the 'cores' stand for prestellar cores that collapse into a single binary. The mass is between ? and ? Msun, size between ? and ?. A typical prestellar core have a radius of 0.1 pc, density > 10^4 cm-3, and velocity dispersion 0.5 km/s. 

/Turbulent fragmentation/. A very low level of turbulence (alpha_turb ~ 0.025) is enough for most cores in an ensemble to form more than one star. (Goodwin et al. 2004b). As turbulence increase, the number of stars that form increases.

Fragmentation occurs in a 'disk-like' mode in circumstellar accretion regions

Fragmentation occurs for some regions with high density beyond 50 - 100 AU from the central star. (Gawryszczak et al., 2006).

Summary: turbulent cores generally fragment into several stars: approximately one per /initial/ Jeans mass in the core. 



* Star Cluster
** Dust
*** Gnedin2008
Table 1 provides parameters for the dust extinction law fits. Assume
\(N_H\) is gas column density (as opposed to hydrogen column density).

*** Corrales2016
This paper cited [@Draine2003], but actually using data from both
[@Weingartner2001] and _Draine2003_, as the latter extends the spectrum
to X-ray, which is the focus of this paper.

** Supermassive Black Hole Seed
From [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08892]]: Due to the theory of
primordial star formation and the observed first chemical enrichment,
the most likely candidates for seed black holes (Volonteri 2010; Latif
\& Ferrara 2016) are the remnants of Population iii stars (Madau \& Rees
2001; Bromm et al. 2002; Schneider et al. 2002), the direct collapse of
primordial gas (Bromm \& Loeb 2003; Koushiappas et al. 2004; Agarwal et
al. 2012), or via a massive quasi-star formed from collisions in nuclear
star clusters in the early Universe (Baumgarte \& Shapiro 1999;
Portegies Zwart et al. 1999; Devecchi \& Volonteri 2009).

*** Latif:2016

1. BH formation scenarios:

   - core-collapse of massive stars (Ciardi \& Ferrara 2005; Bromm

     1.

   - dynamical evolution of dense nuclear star clusters, (Baumgarte \&
     Shapiro 1999; Portegies Zwart et al. 1999; Devecchi \& Volonteri

     1.

   - collapse of a protogalactic metal free gas cloud. Here I focus on
     scenario ii.

2. Some backgrounds:

   - The earlier studies suggested dense stellar clusters with more than
     \(10^7\) stars are required for the run-away collapse to occur (Lee
     1987; Quinlan \& Shapiro 1990). Binary heating stops the core
     collapse in less massive stellar clusters (Heggie 1975; Hut et
     al. 1992). Moreover, the core collapse timescale has to be shorter
     than \(\sim 3\) Myr, otherwise mass loss from the supernova may
     halt the core collapse.
   - Mass segregation instability can lead to for mation of BH seed even
     in less massive clusters (Spitzer 1969; Vishniac 1978; Begelman \&
     Rees 1978), if mass segregation occurs within the first 3 Myr. Need
     low metallicity clusters where mass loss from stellar winds is
     expected to be minimum (Hirschi 2007; Glebbeek et al. 2009).
   - merging of many stellar mass BHs or a supra-exponential growth of
     stellar mass black holes in a cluster by dense cold gas flows
     Alexander \& Natarajan (2014). Will not work, BHs will be thrown
     away.
   - Run-away merging of stellar mass black holes in the core of a dense
     cluster mediated by the extremely large inflows of gas (Davies,
     Miller, \& Bellovary 2011; Lupi et al. 2014).

3. Compact star clusters

   - Collapse timescale has to be shorter than \(\sim 3\)~Myr.
   - Number of collisions and ther increase in mass per collision
     strongly depend on half-mass radius. (Portegies Zwart \& McMillan
     2002). The mass of a Very Massive Star (VMS) linearly increases
     with the initial central density of a cluster.
   - At hiehger metallicities, fragmentation occrus at densities at low
     as \(10^3 {\rm cm^{-3}}\), resulting in the core collapse time
     longer than 3 Myr (Omukai et al. 2008; Devecchi \& Volonteri 2009;
     Devecchi et al. 2012).
   - Large accretion rates and efficient star formation are required for
     the formation of such compact nuclear stellar. By performming 3D
     cosmological simulations, Latif et al. (2016) find that a dense
     cluster may also form for \(Z/Z_{\odot} \ge 10^{-4}\) in the
     presence of a strong UV flux.

*** Portegies-Zwart:1999
*** Katz:2015
My summary: Kate:2015 set initial conditions for simulations of an star
cluster with NBODY6 from the gas cloud forming in the core of the
metal-enriched halo from zoom-in simulation of mini-halos. They find
that the mass of the VMS can reach \(>400~\msun\) in clusters with
stellar masses \(\approx 10^4~\msun\) and over \(1000~\msun\) for more
massive and denser cluster.

Latif:2016's summary: Katz et al. (2015) used a combination of
hydrodynamical cosmological simulations and direct N-body simulations to
estimate the mass of a VMS forming via stellar run-away collisions in a
metal poor stellar cluster. They found that a VMS of \(\ge 400~\msun\)
can form in a stellar cluster of \(10^4~\msun\) at z = 15 and may reach
up to a \(1000~\msun\) for a cluster mass of a few times \(10^5~\msun\).

1. Methods

   Simualte evolusion of a pair of neighboring high-redshift mini-halos
   with zoom-in RAMSES simulation. The central nuclear star cluster
   (NSC) can be enriched to a critical metallicity, sufficient for Pop.
   II star formation at \(z \approx 27\). From the gas cloud forming in
   the core of the metal-enriched halo, they set initial conditions for
   simulations of an star cluster with NBODY6. The final mass of the VMS
   can reach \(>400~\msun\) in clusters with stellar masses
   \(\approx 10^4~\msun\) and over \(1000~\msun\) for more massive and
   denser cluster.

2. My concerns

   Are the initial conditions of the sampled star cluster realistic?

*** SILCC: chemical evolution

1. On the SILCC project (led by S. C. O. Glover?) (Seifried et al. 2017)
   4 chemical convergence criteria are proposed. See logs.org for how my
   simulations meet these criteria.

** Escape of ionizing photon from MC
*** Howard (2017)

1. Initial conditios

   n = 100 cm-3, corresponding to tff = 4.4 Myr (assuming \(\mu\) =
   1.4). Masses = \(10^{4-6}~\msun\).

2. Method

   include radiation pressure adopting a single UV opacity.

*** [@Howard:2018]}
\paragraph{Escape fraction from populations}

- Sampling discrete distribution following \(M^\alpha\) and
  \(\alpha = -1.5\) or \(-2.5\).

*** Howard:2018a
Todo: compare Z dependence.

- Star clusters form in filaments and move with the filamentary gas
  flows.
- Clusters grow by gas inflow from their host filaments and by merging
  events.
- Forms 229 and 146 {*cluster particles*}.
- Particle merging is allowed.
- Lowering Z results in higher \(f_{\rm star}\), contrary to what we
  find. A factor of \(\sim 4\) difference due to metallicity difference.
  At sub-solar metallicity, the radiation produced by the young stars
  exerts less pressure on the surrounding gas because the opacity is
  lower, allowing the YMC to continue accreting gas throughout its
  entire history.
- Subgrid model for star formation: Samping Chabrier IMF with \(20\%\)
  efficiency.
- Radiative transfer: raytracing scheme. Radiation pressure is included.

** Simulations
*** Santistevan2021 (hot paper 2021-02-19)
Hot paper narrative:

- Intro: In hierarchical structure formation, metal-poor stars in the MW originate from mergers of lower-mass galaxies. We therefore expect that metal-poor stars have isotropic random orbits.

- The key answer: what is the origin of the bias of metal-poor stars on
  prograde disk orbit and what can we learn from it?

- Their interpretation, or conclusion, is ...

- GIZMO, FIRE project.

  - fairly state-of-the-art hydro code for galactic simulations.
  - radiative cooling/heating, including redshift-dependent cosmic UV
    background, track the abundance of 11 elements.
  - Feedback processes: core-collapse and Ia supernovae, stellar winds,
    radiation pressure, photoionization, and photo-electric heating.
  - Metal poor stars: do not model metal enrichment from Pop III stars.
    Start with gas elements with a Z floor of [Fe/H] = -4. They said
    this is supported by both simulations and observations, and they
    claim that the strength of the prograde bias does not depend on the
    initial low metallicity, so the choice of this number is
    unimportant.

- The setup of the simulations

  - (Table 1): MW/M31 mass.
  - Resolution: softening length of 4 for stars, 40 pc for DM particles,
    and 1 pc hydro.
  - Galaxy sample should reflect typical formation histories of MW/M31
    like galaxies.

- Selecting metal-poor stars in retrograde motion: Eq. 1-2.

  - Fig.1: show all metal-poor star particles within their seleciton
    region. J_phi is the z-component of the angular momentum. Jz is
    another quantity. Small means it is near the disk plane.
  - We see an overabundance of metal-poor stars line in the prograde
    box.
  - track theses stars back in time to find their origin,

- Results

  - 3.1

    - Fig 2: prograde bias, versus stellar iron abundance. Thick black
      line show the medians across all 12 hosts. Consistent with MW
      observations.
    - Green box: a little counter-intuitive.
    - compare with H3 survey

      - Fig 3: Same selection criteria as the H3 survey. The crosses are
        from the H3 survey.
      - Fig 4: just show the result do not depend on the way that they
        spatially or kinematically select metal-poor stars

  - 3.2, source of the prograde bias

    - Fig 2: no large diﬀerence in the prograde bias for stars that
      formed in-situ versus ex-situ

    - Fig 6: This primary merger typically contributed ∼ 24 per cent of
      all prograde metal-poor stars, higher than the fraction that
      formed in-situ.

  - 3.3, How did the prograde bias evolve over time?

    - Fig 7. arrow show primary, ..., mergers. (see conclusion).

      - Conclusion: For all of these variations, they conclude that the
        prograde bias is a global feature of these MW/M31-mass galaxies.

  - 3.5 Correlations with galaxy properties

    - Fig 8. Conclusion is no strong correlation is found.

      - 

        1. the median oﬀset angle between the angular momentum vector of
           the host's disk and the angular momentum vector of the
           primary merger's orbit
        2. the lookback time when the primary merger occurred,
        3. the stellar mass of the primary merger,
        4. the stellar mass of the primary merger,

      - *This indicates that the strength of the prograde bias has a
        complicated dependence on galaxy formation/merger history, which

** Escape of Ionizing Photons
*** Observations
**** Overview

(From Izotov:2018) A few galaxies with high LyC escape fraction are
known at high redshifts:

- Ion2 at z = 3.218 [@Vanzella:2015], \(\sim 60 \%\)
- Ion3 at z = 3.999 [@Vanzella:2018], \(\gtrsim 30\%\) A2218-Flanking at
  \(z \approx 2.5\), [@Bian:2017],
- up to \(72 \%\) five star-forming galaxies at z = 0.3. [@Izotov:2018]

**** Bian:2017

- A2218-Flanking, a lensed compact dwarf galaxy at redshift
  \(z \approx 2.5\).
- fesc \(\gtrsim 30\%\)
- Find that LyC photons are easier to escape in low-mass galaxies.

**** Izotov:2018

- 5 compact SFGs. seen in the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) NUV
  acquisition images.
- z in the range 0.3 - 0.43, fesc = 40 and 70% from two of the galaxies.
- fesc decreases with increasing M*, but with a large scatter
- We argue that one possible source driving the escape of ionizing
  radiation is stellar winds and radiation from hot massive stars.
- The most reliable selection criterion for LyC leakers is the peak
  separation of the Ly-alpha profile Vsep which is strongly
  anticorrelated to the LyC escape fraction fesc(LyC),

**** Shapley:2016

- Q1549-C25, \(\ge 51\%\)
- Model the spectral energy distribution infer fesc.

**** Summary
Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations of five compact star-forming
galaxies at redshifts \(z\) in the range 0.2993--0.4317 shows LyC
emission with fesc(galaxy) in a range of 2-72 per cent.

/Ion2/ and /Q1549-C25/ are the only two \(z \sim 3\) galaxies with a
direct spectroscopic detection of uncontaminated LyC emission. Escape
fractions of \(\gtrsim 50\%\) is inferred from both of them based on
simulations of the distribution of HI absorbers in both the
intergalactic and circumgalactic medium \cite{Vanzella:2016}
\cite{Shapley:2016}

[@Vanzella:2018] reported the highest redshift individually-confirmed
LyC-leaky galaxy {/Ion3/} at z = 4, % and {/A2218-Flanking/} at
\(z \approx 2.5\) is measured to have \(f_{\rm esc, gal} \gtrsim 30\%\)
[@Bian:2017].

*** Simulations

**** Gnedin:2008

- Escape fraction of \(1\% - 3\%\) over the entire redshift interval (3
  < \(z\) < 9) and veries by more than an order of magnitude along
  different lines of sight, for a massive galaxies and SFR
  \(\approx 1-5 \ {\rm M_\odot} \ {\rm yr}^{-1}\).
  \(\langle f_{\rm esc}\rangle\) declines steeply at lower masses and
  SFR. Absorption by dust is considered.
- The low values of escape fractions are due to a small fraction of
  young stars located just outside the edge of the H i disk. This
  fraction is smaller in disks of smaller galaxies.
- Alternative method: direct measurements of HI column density at
  \(z \sim 3\).
- *Absorption by dust* Dust may contribute significantly to the
  absorption of ionizing radiation (e.g., Weingartner \& Draine 2001).
- Compare with previous work:

  - Siana et al. 2007: Lyman continuum escape fractions in galaxies at
    \(z \sim 1\), \(f_{esc} \lesssim 0.1\).

**** Arata:2019
A number of literatures have examined the escape fraction of UV photons
from galaxies. Using zoom-in initial conditions in cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations, _Arata:2019_ investigate three massive
galaxies and find the escape fraction of UV photons fluctuates in the
range of 0.2 -- 0.8 with a time-averaged value of 0.3. They find that
gas and dust are ejected from star-forming regions by supernova
feedback, allowing the UV photons to escape.

**** Ma2015
[@Ma2015] studied the escape fraction of ionizing photons from
less-massive galaxies with halo mass
\(M_{\rm h} \sim 10^9 - 10^{11} ~\msun\) and showed that
\(f_{\rm esc}^{\rm gal}\) has large time variability and the
time-averaged \(f_{\rm esc}^{\rm gal}\) generally remains \(< \sim 5\)
per cent.

Using zoom-in initial conditions in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, \cite{Arata:2019} investigate three massive galaxies and find the escape fraction of UV photons fluctuates in the range of 20 per cent -- 80 per cent with a time-averaged value of 30 per cent. They find that gas and dust are ejected from star-forming regions by supernova feedback, allowing the UV photons to escape.

*** How to measure fesc from galaxies?

Direct detection of leaking LyC flux.

**** Choi2020

- Choi2020 (2020ApJ...902...54C): new method, measure fesc from individual resolved stars by comparing the number of ionizing photons produced by stars to the number that are either absorbed by dust or consumed by ionizing the surrounding neutral hydrogen. Found substantial fesc (~25%) from NGC 4214 (local galaxy).
- Method:
	  - modeled SEDs of resolved stars within NGC 4214 to infer their intrinsic stellar properties, as well as the intervening dust: using a stellar SED ﬁtting technique optimized for large resolved star datasets, called the Bayesian Extinction And Stellar Tool (BEAST; Gordon et al. 2016).
	  - Formula:
		[[./images/f1.png]]
			- first term measured by combining ionizing photons produced by all stars in a region of interest, second term from the isotropically emitted extinction-corrected Hα recombination emission-line luminosity of the region. /The ﬁrst two termsare independent of viewing angle??/
			- third term is challenging: very along sightlines.
- Conclusion:
	  - demonstrate a new method for measuring the escape fraction of ionizing photons.
	  - supports the idea that starburst UV-faint dwarf galaxies can provide a sufﬁcient amount of ionizing photons to the intergalactic medium.
- good writing:

#+begin_quote
  Confirming whether faint star forming galaxies were indeed responsible for cosmic reionization requires constraining the fraction of LyC photons that escape (the "escape fraction", fesc) into the IGM.

  To be consistent with reionizing the Universe by redshift z ∼ 6, fesc must be at least 10--30%, depending on the choice of the ionizing photon production efficiency and the faint-end properties (i.e., slope and the limiting magnitude) of the observed rest-frame UV luminosity functions (e.g., Ouchi et al. 2009; Finkelstein et al. 2012; Robertson et al. 2013; Bouwens et al. 2015; Khaire et al. 2016; Ishigaki et al. 2018).

  fesc at a level of > 20% has been measured only very recently for a small number of galaxies based on direct detection of leaking LyC flux (e.g., Vanzella et al. 2012; Shapley et al. 2016; Vanzella et al. 2016; Bian et al. 2017; Naidu et al. 2017; Izotov et al. 2018a).

* Code

** Basics
Euler: grid based, fixed space. Lagarigian: moving particle.

Kelvin-Helmholtz instability: KHIs occur when velocity shear is present
at the interface between two ﬂuids.

Reyleigh-Taylor instability: RTIs occur when a denser ﬂuid is
accelerated by a less dense ﬂuid. Examples: water suspended above oil;
supernova explosions in which expanding core gas is accelerated into
denser shell gas.

** Code
*** Summary of widely used codes
**** Grid based, AMR

- *ART* (Adaptive Reﬁnement Tree) is a N-body + gas dynamics AMR
  (Adaptive Mesh Reﬁnement) code (Kravtsov 1999). Advantages: resolve
  shocks within 1-2 cells.
- *ENZO* is an Eulerian AMR hybrid code (N-body + gas dynamics) that was
  originally written by Greg Bryan and Michael Norman at the National
  Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois
  (Bryan & Norman 1997). ENZO uses the piecewise parabolic method
  (Colella & Woodward 1984, PPM) for solving ﬂuid equations. There is
  also ENZO-PPM. PPM is a higher order accurate version of Godunov's
  method with an accurate piecewise parabolic interpolation and a
  non-linear Riemann solver for shock conditions. The method is third
  order accurate in space and second order in time for ﬁxed
  time-stepping.
- *FLASH* is an AMR hybrid code (N-body + gas dynamics) developed by the
  ASC Center at the University of Chicago (Fryxell et al. 2000).
- *ORION*, developed by Richard Klein and Chris McKee. AMR
  magneto-radiation-hydrodynamics. 

**** SPH

- *GASOLINE*: a parallel Tree + SPH code, described in Wadsley, Stadel &
  Quinn (2004). The code is an extension to the N-body gravity code
  PKDGRAV developed by Stadel (2001). GASOLINE uses Artificial Viscosity
  to resolve shocks. It uses a standard spline smoothing kernel
  (Monaghan 1992) with compact support for the softening of the
  gravitational and SPH quantities.
- *GADGET-2* is a TreeSPH code (Springel, Yoshida & White 2001; Springel
  2005). It is the updated version of the GADGET-1. The code is similar
  in character to GASOLINE but uses an entropy conserving formulation of
  SPH. Use a different formulation of AV than GASOLINE.
- *Arepo*: first cosmological simulations of galaxy formation performed
  with the moving mesh code Arepo (Springel, 2010).

*** RAMSES
**** Bleuler 2014

- Sink Particles Creation

  - Sink particles in AMR codes has two types: 'cell-based' and
    'peak-based'.

    - Cell-based. e.g. Krumholz et al. 2014: convergent velocity +
      density threshold.
    - Peak-based. A sink is formed in a small volumes around a density
      peak. The radius is chosen to

**** Geen2016

- Tools used in the paper
	  - RAMSES-RT, a Eulerian adaptive mesh magnetohydrodynamics code rand radiative transfer of UV photons.
- Methods
	  - Profile of the cloud: The cloud is assumed to have a power law density profile with a flat core with \(n_{\rm ext}(r) \propto r^{-\omega}\).
- Theories
	  - Two phases of expansion:
			1. propagation of ionization fronts up to the Stromgren radius (rs);
			2. expansion of the HII region. Time order: 1) recombination time, kyrs; 2) with a sound speed ci = 12.5 km/s in cooling equilibrium. The resultant temperature in he ionized region is 8400 K, given that \(C_s = \sqrt{\gamma P / \rho} \propto \sqrt{T}\).
- Conclusion
	  - The expansion of HII region in clouds is crucial in stellar feedback.
	  - Most of the momentum from a single supernovae is deposited into the dense gas rather than hot diffuse gas.
	  - Supernovae will occur too late to prevent the bulk of star formation in the cloud. (supported by He:2019 and He:2020).

Whilst Eulerian grid based methods are able to resolve and treat
important dynamical instabilities, such as Kelvin--Helmholtz or
Rayleigh--Taylor, these processes are poorly or not at all resolved by
existing SPH techniques. We show that the reason for this is that SPH,
at least in its standard implementation, introduces spurious pressure
forces on particles in regions where there are steep density gradients.
This results in a boundary gap of the size of an SPH smoothing kernel
radius over which interactions are severely damped.

*The blob test*: a cold blog travels in hot gas in supersonic speed.

Grid code:

- ART (AMR)
- CHARM (AMR), an N-body + gas dynamics, AMR code, employing a higher
  order Godunov's method, second-order accurate method in both space and
  time.
- ENZO-PPM (AMR): ENZO uses the piecewise parabolic method
- GASOLINE: a parallel Tree + SPH code, described in Wadsley, Stadel &
  Quinn (2004). The code is an extension to the N-body gravity code
  PKDGRAV developed by Stadel (2001). GASOLINE uses Artificial Viscosity

Conclusion: Whilst Eulerian grid based methods are able to resolve and
treat important dynamical instabilities, such as Kelvin--Helmholtz or
Rayleigh--Taylor, these processes are poorly or not at all resolved by
existing SPH techniques. The reason is that SPH introduces spurious
pressure forces on particles in regions where there are steep density
gradients. The GASOLINE runs are not able to resolve small-scale
instabilities at all through resolution study.
