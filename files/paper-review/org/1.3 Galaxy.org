- Fast Radio Bursts are when the line of sight is alined with the beam,
  while Slow Radio Burst with viewing angles somewhat outside the narrow
  emission beam.

** Simulations
*** Santistevan2021 (hot paper 2021-02-19)
Hot paper narrative:

- Intro: In hierarchical structure formation, metal-poor stars in the MW
  originate from mergers of lower-mass galaxies. We therefore expect
  that metal-poor stars have isotropic random orbits.

- The key answer: what is the origin of the bias of metal-poor stars on
  prograde disk orbit and what can we learn from it?

- Their interpretation, or conclusion, is ...

- GIZMO, FIRE project.

  - fairly state-of-the-art hydro code for galactic simulations.
  - radiative cooling/heating, including redshift-dependent cosmic UV
    background, track the abundance of 11 elements.
  - Feedback processes: core-collapse and Ia supernovae, stellar winds,
    radiation pressure, photoionization, and photo-electric heating.
  - Metal poor stars: do not model metal enrichment from Pop III stars.
    Start with gas elements with a Z floor of [Fe/H] = -4. They said
    this is supported by both simulations and observations, and they
    claim that the strength of the prograde bias does not depend on the
    initial low metallicity, so the choice of this number is
    unimportant.

- The setup of the simulations

  - (Table 1): MW/M31 mass.
  - Resolution: softening length of 4 for stars, 40 pc for DM particles,
    and 1 pc hydro.
  - Galaxy sample should reflect typical formation histories of MW/M31
    like galaxies.

- Selecting metal-poor stars in retrograde motion: Eq. 1-2.

  - Fig.1: show all metal-poor star particles within their seleciton
    region. J_phi is the z-component of the angular momentum. Jz is
    another quantity. Small means it is near the disk plane.
  - We see an overabundance of metal-poor stars line in the prograde
    box.
  - track theses stars back in time to find their origin,

- Results

  - 3.1

    - Fig 2: prograde bias, versus stellar iron abundance. Thick black
      line show the medians across all 12 hosts. Consistent with MW
      observations.
    - Green box: a little counter-intuitive.
    - compare with H3 survey

      - Fig 3: Same selection criteria as the H3 survey. The crosses are
        from the H3 survey.
      - Fig 4: just show the result do not depend on the way that they
        spatially or kinematically select metal-poor stars

  - 3.2, source of the prograde bias

    - Fig 2: no large diﬀerence in the prograde bias for stars that
      formed in-situ versus ex-situ

    - Fig 6: This primary merger typically contributed ∼ 24 per cent of
      all prograde metal-poor stars, higher than the fraction that
      formed in-situ.

  - 3.3, How did the prograde bias evolve over time?

    - Fig 7. arrow show primary, ..., mergers. (see conclusion).

      - Conclusion: For all of these variations, they conclude that the
        prograde bias is a global feature of these MW/M31-mass galaxies.

  - 3.5 Correlations with galaxy properties

    - Fig 8. Conclusion is no strong correlation is found.

      - 

        1. the median oﬀset angle between the angular momentum vector of
           the host's disk and the angular momentum vector of the
           primary merger's orbit
        2. the lookback time when the primary merger occurred,
        3. the stellar mass of the primary merger,
        4. the stellar mass of the primary merger,

      - *This indicates that the strength of the prograde bias has a
        complicated dependence on galaxy formation/merger history, which
        limits our immediate interpretation of how to translate recent
        observations of the pro- grade bias for the MW into a robust
        constraint on its formation history.*

* Galactic Escape Fraction
** Observations
*** Overview
(From Izotov:2018) A few galaxies with high LyC escape fraction are
known at high redshifts:

- Ion2 at z = 3.218 [@Vanzella:2015], \(\sim 60 \%\)
- Ion3 at z = 3.999 [@Vanzella:2018], \(\gtrsim 30\%\) A2218-Flanking at
  \(z \approx 2.5\), [@Bian:2017],
- up to \(72 \%\) five star-forming galaxies at z = 0.3. [@Izotov:2018]

*** Bian:2017

- A2218-Flanking, a lensed compact dwarf galaxy at redshift
  \(z \approx 2.5\).
- fesc \(\gtrsim 30\%\)
- Find that LyC photons are easier to escape in low-mass galaxies.

*** Izotov:2018

- 5 compact SFGs. seen in the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) NUV
  acquisition images.
- z in the range 0.3 - 0.43, fesc = 40 and 70% from two of the galaxies.
- fesc decreases with increasing M*, but with a large scatter
- We argue that one possible source driving the escape of ionizing
  radiation is stellar winds and radiation from hot massive stars.
- The most reliable selection criterion for LyC leakers is the peak
  separation of the Ly-alpha profile Vsep which is strongly
  anticorrelated to the LyC escape fraction fesc(LyC),

*** Shapley:2016

- Q1549-C25, \(\ge 51\%\)
- Model the spectral energy distribution infer fesc.

*** Vanzella:2018

- ~60%

*** Izotov2016

*** Summary
Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations of five compact star-forming
galaxies at redshifts \(z\) in the range 0.2993--0.4317 shows LyC
emission with fesc(galaxy) in a range of 2-72 per cent.

/Ion2/ and /Q1549-C25/ are the only two \(z \sim 3\) galaxies with a
direct spectroscopic detection of uncontaminated LyC emission. Escape
fractions of \(\gtrsim 50\%\) is inferred from both of them based on
simulations of the distribution of HI absorbers in both the
intergalactic and circumgalactic medium \cite{Vanzella:2016}
\cite{Shapley:2016}

[@Vanzella:2018] reported the highest redshift individually-confirmed
LyC-leaky galaxy {/Ion3/} at z = 4, % and {/A2218-Flanking/} at
\(z \approx 2.5\) is measured to have \(f_{\rm esc, gal} \gtrsim 30\%\)
[@Bian:2017].

** How to measure fesc from galaxies?

- Direct detection of leaking LyC flux.

*** Choi2020

- Choi2020 (2020ApJ...902...54C): new method, measure fesc from
  individual resolved stars by comparing the number of ionizing photons
  produced by stars to the number that are either absorbed by dust or
  consumed by ionizing the surrounding neutral hydrogen. Found
  substantial fesc (~25%) from NGC 4214 (local galaxy).
- Method:

  - modeled SEDs of resolved stars within NGC 4214 to infer their
    intrinsic stellar properties, as well as the intervening dust: using
    a stellar SED ﬁtting technique optimized for large resolved star
    datasets, called the Bayesian Extinction And Stellar Tool (BEAST;
    Gordon et al. 2016).
  - Formula:

    [[../images/f1.png]]

    - first term measured by combining ionizing photons produced by all
      stars in a region of interest, second term from the isotropically
      emitted extinction-corrected Hα recombination emission-line
      luminosity of the region. /The ﬁrst two termsare independent of
      viewing angle??/
    - third term is challenging: very along sightlines.

- Conclusion:

  - demonstrate a new method for measuring the escape fraction of
    ionizing photons.
  - supports the idea that starburst UV-faint dwarf galaxies can provide
    a sufﬁcient amount of ionizing photons to the intergalactic medium.

- good writing:

#+begin_quote
  Confirming whether faint star forming galaxies were indeed responsible
  for cosmic reionization requires constraining the fraction of LyC
  photons that escape (the "escape fraction", fesc) into the IGM.
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  To be consistent with reionizing the Universe by redshift z ∼ 6, fesc
  must be at least 10--30%, depending on the choice of the ionizing
  photon production efficiency and the faint-end properties (i.e., slope
  and the limiting magnitude) of the observed rest-frame UV luminosity
  functions (e.g., Ouchi et al. 2009; Finkelstein et al. 2012; Robertson
  et al. 2013; Bouwens et al. 2015; Khaire et al. 2016; Ishigaki et
  al. 2018).
#+end_quote

#+begin_quote
  fesc at a level of > 20% has been measured only very recently for a
  small number of galaxies based on direct detection of leaking LyC flux
  (e.g., Vanzella et al. 2012; Shapley et al. 2016; Vanzella et
  al. 2016; Bian et al. 2017; Naidu et al. 2017; Izotov et al. 2018a).

  - Method

    - new Keck Cosmic Web Imager spatially-resolved spectroscopy of the
      resonant Mg ii 2800 Å doublet from a redshift 0.36 galaxy,
      J1503+3644,
    - The measured flux ratio of the red and blue Mg ii emission line
      doublet estimates the neutral gas column density ---> relative
      escape fraction
    - Using the Reddy et al. (2016) attenuation law to fit theoretical
      stellar continuum models to the observed FUV stellar continuum
      features. ---> absolute escape fraction

  - Conclusion: Mg ii can predict escape fraction within the Epoch of
    Reionization.
