<figcaption>A massive protostellar disk, or 'toroid', around a group of high-mass stars.</figcaption>
We simulate the formation and collapse of pre-stellar cores at few-au resolution in a set of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) using the grid-based code RAMSES-RT. We adopt, for the first time to our best knowledge, realistic initial/boundary conditions by zooming in on to individual massive pre-stellar cores within the GMC. We identify two distinct modes of fragmentation: â€˜quasi-sphericalâ€™ and â€˜filamentaryâ€™. In both modes, the fragments eventually become embedded in a quasi-steady accretion disc or toroid with radii âˆ¼500â€“5000 au and opening angles H/R âˆ¼ 0.5 âˆ’ 1. The discs/toroids are Toomre stable but the accreted pre-existing fragments are found orbiting the outer disc, appearing as disc fragmentation. Each core converts nearly 100 perâ€‰cent of the gas mass into a few massive stars forming near the disc centre. Large and massive discs around high-mass stars are supported by magnetic pressure in the outer disc, at radii >200â€“1000 au, and turbulent pressure in the inner disc. The most massive core accretes several times more mass than its initial mass, forming a cluster of 8 massive (proto)stars enshrouded by a toroid, suggesting a competitive accretion scenario for the formation of stars above âˆ¼30â€‰MâŠ™. We also find that the Hâ€‰II regions produced by a single massive star remain trapped in the dense circumstellar discs for a few hundred kiloyears, while the dynamic motions of massive stars in wide binaries or multiple systems displace the stars from the densest parts of the disc, allowing UV radiation to escape producing steady or pulsating bipolar Hâ€‰II regions.

<figcaption>
The formation of high-mass stars remains an active area of study, with two main theoretical models proposed. The turbulent core model suggests high-mass stars form monolithically from massive pre-stellar cores supported by turbulence and/or magnetic fields. Alternatively, the competitive accretion model posits that lower-mass seeds accrete unbound gas from their parent giant molecular clouds in a hierarchical process. To help distinguish between these scenarios, this paper (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/arXiv:2210.11629">He & Ricotti 2022</a>) presents results from high-resolution radiation-magnetohydrodynamic simulations. These simulations focus on the collapse of pre-stellar cores within giant molecular clouds. Importantly, they incorporate realistic initial and boundary conditions for the first time to our knowledge. Observations have revealed accretion discs around both intermediate- and high-mass young stars. However, the properties of discs around the most massive stars are still uncertain. The simulations presented in this paper zoom in on individual pre-stellar cores at au (or tens of au) scales. This allows for a detailed study of the fragmentation process. Two modes of fragmentation are identified: quasi-spherical and filamentary. In both cases, the fragments settle into thick accretion discs or toroids that are hundreds to thousands of au in size. The simulations suggest that magnetic and turbulent pressure can support large discs around high-mass stars. Each core converts most of its gas into stars near the disc center. The largest core (> tens of solar masses) forms a cluster through competitive accretion. Smaller cores, on the other hand, follow a track that is close to the turbulence core model.

"Pillars of Creation" caused by photoionization feedback (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.489.1880H/abstract">He, Ricotti & Geen, 2019</a>). The thermal pressure resulting from photoionization heating efficiently disperses the parent cloud. I show that photoionization feedback is efficient at dispersing dense molecular clouds before the onset of supernova explosions. Based on a set of simulations of collapsing molecular clouds extending a wide range of masses and densities, I find a strong linear correlation between the star formation timescale regulated by photoionization feedback, $t_{\rm SF}$, and the cloud crossing time of HII-fronts, $t_{\rm cr}$, typically at a speed of $c_s \sim 7$ km/s. I find the following empirical relation: the ratio of $t_{\rm SF}$ to the free-fall time, $t_{\rm ff} = (\pi/2) (R/v_{\rm esc})$, roughly equals $v_{\rm esc}/2.6$ km/s, where $v_{\rm esc}$ is the escape velocity at the cloud surface. We also find that the star formation efficiency per free-fall time scales with the density to the second power and approaches ~20 percent in very dense scenarios. Molecular clouds with escape velocities above ~7 km/s and high density (> 1000 cm$^{-3}$) deposit over 15 percent of the gas into stars and form gravitationally bound star clusters which appears to be globular cluster progenitors.
<!-- College student level summary: -->
<!-- This paper uses computer simulations to study how stars form within giant clouds of gas and dust in space. The simulations vary properties of the clouds like their mass and density to better understand how star formation occurs in different environments, both near our galaxy and far away in the early universe. The results provide insight into the distribution of masses of newly formed stars, the rate at which stars form from cloud material, and what fraction of a cloud's gas ultimately gets converted into stars before the cloud disperses. This helps scientists understand the physics that governs how galaxies build up their stars and evolve over billions of years. -->

<!-- Performance of my analytic method of computing 2pcf compared with current fastest numerical method. -->
In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210706918H/abstract">He (2021)</a>, I present a new analytic method for calculating galaxy two-point correlation functions (TPCFs) that is accurate, efficient, and applicable to surveys with regular geometries. Closed-form formulas are derived for the normalized random-random pair counts RR for rectangular, cuboidal, circular and spherical survey volumes. Algorithms are also suggested to compute the normalized data-random pair counts DR analytically by fully accounting for edge effects. When tested on a galaxy catalog from the EAGLE simulation, this new analytic method computes RR and DR with perfect accuracy and zero variance, with speeds 3-6 orders of magnitude faster than Monte Carlo methods and 2.5 orders of magnitude faster than tree-based algorithms. For surveys with masks, irregular shapes or weighted patterns, the method is limited, but it provides significant speed improvements for basic TPCF calculations .

<!-- Emission from neutron stars and accretion disks in low-mass X-ray binaries is not isotropic. Previous predictions of the anisotropy factors for burst flux assumes a geometrically flat disk. In this case, the ratio of the reflected and direct burst flux (reflection fraction) peaks at 0.5. Recently (2014), however, detailed observations showed that the reflection fraction could reach to ~6 at the tail of a superburst (top right of the feature image), which is much higher than what a system with a flat disk can account for. We create numerical models to calculate the anisotropy factors of radiation for different disk shapes, including a disk with a thick bulge in the inner region (top left). We present the anisotropy factors of the direct and reflected burst flux separately, as well as the anisotropy of the persistent flux (bottom right). Reflection fractions substantially larger than unity are produced in case the inner accretion disk steeply increases in height, such that part of the star is blocked from view (bottom left). Such a geometry could possibly be induced by the X-ray burst if X-ray heating causes the inner disk to puff up.  -->

However, recent observations showed that the reflection fraction can reach ~6 at the tail of a superburst, which is much higher than what a flat disk can account for. To investigate this discrepancy, I created numerical models to calculate the anisotropy factors for different disk shapes (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...819...47H/abstract">He & Keep, 2016</a>). One model includes a disk with a thick bulge in the inner region. The anisotropy factors of the direct and reflected burst flux, as well as the anisotropy of the persistent flux, are presented. The results show that reflection fractions larger than unity are produced when the inner accretion disk steeply increases in height, blocking part of the star from view. This geometry could be induced by the X-ray burst if X-ray heating causes the inner disk to puff up. These findings suggest that the anisotropy of radiation in low-mass X-ray binaries is strongly influenced by the shape and height of the inner accretion disk.
